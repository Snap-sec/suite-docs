## Overview

The Project-Centric Workspace provides a dedicated environment for managing threat modeling at the application or microservice level.  
Each project includes its own metrics, endpoints, threats, members, and lifecycle tracking — enabling structured workflows, clear ownership, and deep visibility into security posture.
