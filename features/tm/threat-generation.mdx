## Overview

The Automated Threat Generation Engine produces realistic, high-quality threats aligned with OWASP and CWE security standards.  
Using prompt-driven modeling, it automatically analyzes application context, request patterns, and architectural clues to create accurate threat scenarios — reducing manual workload and ensuring consistency across all projects.

## Key Capabilities
