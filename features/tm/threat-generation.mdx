## Overview

The Threat Generation Engine automates the creation of realistic, high-quality threat scenarios by analyzing API endpoints, request behaviors, and architectural patterns.\
Using advanced prompt-driven modeling, Snapsec generates OWASP- and CWE-aligned threats that maintain consistency, accuracy, and depth across all projects — eliminating the need for manual threat identification.
