## Overview

Endpoint Discovery & Threat Mapping gives teams complete visibility into how threats relate to their underlying API surface.  
The system automatically identifies endpoints, methods, routes, and hosts — then maps all associated threats to reveal hot spots, high-risk routes, and vulnerable service areas across applications and microservices.

## Value

Gain clearer insight into how threats align with your API surface.  
By mapping threats directly to endpoints and routes, teams can focus remediation on the most exposed areas, improve accuracy, and strengthen defense across distributed architectures.
