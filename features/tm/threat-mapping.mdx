## Overview

Endpoint Threat Mapping provides deep visibility into how threats align with your API surface.\
Snapsec automatically discovers API endpoints and connects them with associated threats, methods, hosts, and density patterns — enabling teams to identify high-risk routes and understand their attack surface with precision.
