## Overview

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures secure, structured, and least-privilege access across all threat modeling projects.  
By defining clear project-level roles — Owner, Manager, and Member — Snapsec enforces permission boundaries, protects sensitive threat data, and aligns access with team responsibilities.
