## Overview

Project-Based Threat Modeling allows teams to structure their threat analysis around applications, services, or microservices.  
Each project maintains its own endpoints, members, metrics, and lifecycle views — ensuring clarity, focus, and complete traceability across distributed systems and large engineering teams.

## Key Capabilities

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Project-Centric Organization" icon="folder-tree">
    Group threats by application, microservice, or API stack to maintain structured and isolated threat views.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Per-Project Metrics" icon="chart-column">
    Track severity distribution, progress status, modeling depth, and resolution rates for each project.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Endpoint-Level Mapping" icon="sitemap">
    Connect threats directly to specific endpoints, methods, or routes within a project for deeper clarity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dedicated Member Access" icon="users">
    Assign members to individual projects and collaborate with role-based permissions and activity tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Independent Threat Lifecycles" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Manage each project’s threat lifecycle independently — from Pending to Fix Verified.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scalable for Microservices" icon="layer-group">
    Ideal for large ecosystems with multiple services, enabling clear separation and modular threat modeling.

## Value

Structure threat modeling around the systems you actually operate.  
Project-based visibility improves clarity, distribution of responsibility, and accountability — making it easier for engineering teams to manage threats across complex environments.
