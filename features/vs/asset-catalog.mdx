## Overview

The Full Asset Catalog provides a unified, always-up-to-date inventory of every asset scanned by the Vulnerability Scanner.  
It consolidates hosts, services, applications, APIs, and cloud resources into a single source of truth — complete with visibility into health, scan coverage, and exposure levels across your environment.
