## Overview

Automated SLA Tracking ensures that every vulnerability synced to Snapsec VM is immediately governed by your organization’s remediation policies.  
No manual configuration is required — SLAs, deadlines, breach alerts, and follow-up actions are automatically applied based on severity, asset type, and environment.
