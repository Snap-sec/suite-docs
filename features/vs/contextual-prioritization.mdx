## Overview

Contextual Prioritization helps teams focus on the vulnerabilities that truly matter.  
Each finding includes enriched context — severity, asset criticality, environment, exploitability signals, and operational metadata — allowing your teams to allocate effort where it delivers the highest risk reduction.

## Key Capabilities

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Severity Badges" icon="shield-halved">
    Clearly labeled CVSS-based severity levels highlight the urgency of each vulnerability for faster triage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Asset Importance Awareness" icon="server">
    Prioritize findings based on the criticality, role, and business value of impacted assets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Environment Context" icon="cloud">
    Distinguish vulnerabilities across production, staging, testing, or development environments for smarter action.
  </Card>
  <Card title="State & Lifecycle Tracking" icon="tags">
    Track each vulnerability’s current lifecycle state — open, in-progress, accepted risk, or resolved.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Metadata Enrichment" icon="info-circle">
    Every finding contains technical details, timestamps, affected components, and exploit references for accurate decision-making.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Prioritization" icon="ranking-star">
    Combine severity, asset context, exploitability, and environment signals to surface what needs attention first.

## Value

Reduce noise and eliminate guesswork.  
Contextual prioritization ensures your security and engineering teams focus on high-impact issues rather than drowning in low-risk noise — improving remediation speed and overall security posture.
