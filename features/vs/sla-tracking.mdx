## Overview

Automated SLA Tracking ensures that every vulnerability synced into Snapsec VM instantly inherits your organization’s remediation timelines and enforcement rules.  
No manual setup is required — severity, asset type, and environment automatically determine the SLA deadline, escalation path, and breach behavior.
