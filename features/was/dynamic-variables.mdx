## Overview

Dynamic Variable Injection ensures that every API request and scan automatically uses the correct environment-specific values.\
Whether you're testing against Dev, Test, QA, or Sandbox, variables like URLs, tokens, IDs, and custom parameters are injected in real time — eliminating inconsistencies and improving testing accuracy.
