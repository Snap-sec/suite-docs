## Overview

Multi-Environment Configuration Management allows teams to create isolated API testing environments such as Test, Development, Sandbox, and custom workspaces.\
Each environment maintains its own set of variables — like URLs, tokens, IDs, and custom parameters — ensuring accurate, context-aware API testing without cross-environment conflicts.

## Key Capabilities

</Columns>

## Value

Eliminate cross-environment confusion and ensure every scan runs with accurate, environment-specific variables.\
This leads to more reliable testing, fewer false results, and clearer understanding of API behavior across your development lifecycle.
