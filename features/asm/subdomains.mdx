## Overview

Subdomain Monitoring provides deep visibility into your organization’s online presence.  
Snapsec continuously tracks live and inactive subdomains, detects open ports, checks for WAF protection, and identifies exposed or misconfigured endpoints.  
It ensures that every subdomain — from production to staging — is accounted for and monitored.
