## Overview

Continuous Asset Discovery keeps your external inventory always up to date.  
Snapsec automatically identifies new subdomains, IPs, ports, and technologies using both active and passive reconnaissance methods.  
It ensures that no asset — even those created temporarily in CI/CD or third-party environments — goes unnoticed.
