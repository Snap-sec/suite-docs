## Overview

Reusable Auth & Header Configurations allow teams to define consistent authentication and header profiles for API security testing.\
Whether you’re working with Authorization tokens, API keys, session headers, or custom metadata, these profiles ensure every scan is authenticated correctly and executed with the right request context.
