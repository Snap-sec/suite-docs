## Overview

The Clustered API Vulnerability Repository provides a unified, fully enriched view of all API-specific vulnerabilities detected across scans and projects.\
Each issue is grouped, contextualized, and mapped to its associated requests, scans, and environments — enabling fast, accurate triage and deep security insights.
