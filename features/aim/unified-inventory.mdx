## Overview

Unified Asset Inventory serves as the single source of truth for every digital asset in your organization.  
It aggregates assets from multiple sources — ASM, CI/CD pipelines, scanners, cloud providers, and manual imports — into a single, structured inventory.  
This ensures complete visibility across your entire attack surface, eliminating silos between security, DevOps, and infrastructure teams.
