## Overview

Collaborative Asset Editing turns AIM into a living, community-driven inventory.  
It enables authorized users to view, update, and enrich asset properties such as names, tags, or exposure status â€” directly through a public-facing interface.  
This crowdsourced model helps organizations maintain an always-accurate inventory without overloading administrators or security teams.
