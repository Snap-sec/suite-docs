## Overview

Ownership & Accountability Mapping helps organizations bring structure and responsibility to their digital landscape.  
Every asset within AIM can be linked to a defined owner, team, or business unit â€” making it easy to identify who is responsible for maintaining, securing, or remediating it.  
This ownership clarity bridges the gap between IT, security, and business operations.
