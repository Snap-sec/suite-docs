## Overview

Auto Risk Assessment enables AIM to intelligently assign a dynamic risk score to every asset.  
It correlates vulnerability severity, exposure state, and inter-asset relationships to measure how critical an asset truly is in your environment.  
This helps teams instantly prioritize which assets demand attention first — without manual scoring or guesswork.

## Value

By automating asset risk scoring, AIM removes subjectivity from prioritization.
