## Overview

Blast Radius Explorer turns AIM into a living dependency graph.  
It links APIs, IPs, DNS, certificates, repos, registries, applications, workstations, and vendors — then models how risk can propagate if any single node is compromised.  
With one view, teams see *what breaks next* and fix the few assets that collapse the most risk.

## Key Capabilities

## Value

Move from flat lists to *causal* visibility.  
By understanding dependencies and simulating failure paths, teams cut noise, align remediation to business impact, and measurably shrink real attack surface.
