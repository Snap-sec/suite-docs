## Overview

AIM eliminates the burden of manual asset maintenance with fully automated discovery and synchronization.  
Connected adapters continuously monitor their respective sources — cloud providers, code repositories, DNS records, or scanners — and automatically fetch new or updated assets as they appear.  
This ensures your inventory always reflects the latest state of your digital footprint without requiring any human intervention.
