## Postman Integration with Snapsec Threat Management

Use the **Postman integration** to automatically import your API endpoints into Snapsec Threat Management (TM).  
This allows the threat modeler to analyze your API surfaces, generate risks, and build threat scenarios based on real request metadata.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling the Postman integration, ensure you have:

- A **Postman account**
- A **Postman API Key**
- Collections containing API requests you want to analyze
- A Threat Management project created inside Snapsec (optional but recommended)

You can create or retrieve your Postman API Key from:  
**https://postman.com/settings/me/api-keys**

---

## 2. Configure Postman in Snapsec TM

1. Go to **Threat Management → Integrations**  
2. Select **Postman** from the list of adapters  
3. Click **Install** or **Configure**  
4. Provide the required fields:
   - **Postman API Key**
   - Optional: Select a TM project to associate imported endpoints with

Click **Install Now** to complete setup.

If successful, Snapsec will show **Connected** status for the integration.

## 3. What Postman imports into Threat Management

Once connected, Snapsec TM automatically ingests:

### **Endpoint Metadata**
- URL paths  
- Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)  
- Request bodies and parameters  
- Headers and authentication schemes  

### **Collection Grouping**
- Imported APIs retain their **collection names**  
- Endpoints are mapped to **Threat Management Projects** (if selected)

### **Threat Modeling Inputs**
Imported endpoints become part of:
- **Threat Catalog**  
- **Endpoint List (Requests)**  
- **Automated Threat Detection**  
- **Project-level threat scoring**

Snapsec enriches endpoint data to generate relevant threats (e.g., injection, authorization bypass, SSRF, IDOR).

---

## 4. Refreshing Data

You can refresh your imported Postman APIs anytime:

**Integrations → Postman → Refresh**

This pulls the latest endpoints from your Postman collections.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### **Invalid API Key**
- Regenerate the token and update it in Snapsec TM.  
- Ensure the key has access to the collections you want to import.

### **Endpoints Not Appearing**
- Confirm the API key is still active.  
- Ensure your Postman workspace and collections are not private/restricted.  
- Validate the request structure (Snapsec supports standard Postman schemas).

### **Mapping Issues**
- Make sure the TM project is selected during import (optional but recommended).
