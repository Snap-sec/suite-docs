## Snapsec VM Integration with Threat Management

The **Snapsec VM integration** allows Threat Management (TM) to seamlessly forward discovered threats, validated weaknesses, and API-level exposures into **Snapsec Vulnerability Management**.  
This ensures engineering teams receive actionable vulnerability data enriched with threat context.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling the integration, ensure you have:

- An active **Snapsec VM workspace**  
- A valid **VM API Key**  
- Optional: A dedicated **Assessment** inside VM to store threats coming from TM

You can generate your API key from:

**VM → Settings → API Keys**

---

## 2. Configure Snapsec VM in Threat Management

1. Navigate to **Threat Management → Integrations**  
2. Select **Snapsec VM** from the available integrations  
3. Provide the required fields:
   - **VM API Key**
   - **Assessment for storing threats** (dropdown)
4. Configure optional settings:
   - **Auto-sync severity levels**
   - **Custom headers** (if your VM instance requires them)

Click **Install Now** to activate the integration.

Once connected, the status will show **Connected**.

## 3. What Data Syncs from TM → Snapsec VM

Once enabled, the integration forwards:

### **Threat Records**
- Identified API threats  
- Context: owner, state, project, confidence, severity  
- Affected endpoint information

### **Exposure Details**
- HTTP method  
- URL path  
- Threat category (e.g., Injection, Authentication Bypass, CORS, SSRF)

### **Project-Level Threat Modeling Outputs**
- Threat descriptions  
- Mitigation notes  
- Attack vectors  
- Tags and metadata

### **Automatic Updates**
If auto-sync is enabled, updates to threat status (Acknowledged, Fixed, Verified, etc.) will also sync into the corresponding VM assessment.

---

## 4. Sync Configuration Options

### **Assessment Mapping**
Choose which VM assessment stores TM threats.  
You may use:
- A single unified assessment  
- Separate assessments per project

### **Severity Filters**
Select which severities are synced:
- Critical  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  
- Info  

### **Custom Headers (Optional)**
Use custom header fields if your VM environment requires additional authentication or routing filters.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Invalid API Key  
- Regenerate the key in VM  
- Ensure no extra spaces are copied  

### Threats Not Appearing in VM  
- Check severity sync rules  
- Confirm assessment selection  
- Verify network access to VM endpoint  

### Custom Header Errors  
- Remove headers and test again  
- Confirm proper format: `key: value`
