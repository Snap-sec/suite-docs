## Overview

The **Google Sheets integration** allows AIM to ingest structured asset data directly from your spreadsheets.  
Teams that maintain asset inventories, employee lists, or custom registries in Google Sheets can seamlessly sync them into AIM without manual CSV uploads.

## What This Integration Does

- Connect a Google Sheets document to AIM.  
- Automatically import rows as asset entries.  
- Map sheet columns to AIM asset fields.  
- Keep data synchronized whenever the sheet updates.

This integration is ideal for teams who manage asset information collaboratively in Sheets.

---

## Prerequisites

Before enabling the integration, ensure:

- You have a Google account with access to the target sheet.  
- The sheet is formatted with clear header columns.  
- You have created an AIM API key (if required by your workspace).  

---

## How to Configure

1. Go to **AIM → Integrations**.  
2. Click **Google Sheets → Install**.  
3. Paste the **Google Sheet URL** you want AIM to ingest.  
4. Map each column from the sheet to AIM asset fields (e.g., name, type, owner, description).  
5. Save the integration to begin syncing.

## Data Synced Into AIM

Based on your column mapping, AIM can import:

- Asset names  
- Owners  
- Types (e.g., domain, IP, employee, repo)  
- Tags  
- Notes / descriptions  
- Risk values (optional)  

Each synced row becomes an asset entry inside AIM’s catalog.

---

## Sync Behavior

- Sync runs periodically to detect updates in the sheet.  
- Newly added rows are imported automatically.  
- Modified rows update existing asset records.  
- Deleted rows are not removed unless processed via AIM’s lifecycle controls.
