## Tech Grabber Integration for AIM

The **Tech Grabber** adapter enriches your Asset Inventory by identifying the technologies, frameworks, servers, and platforms associated with your domains, IPs, and applications.

Once enabled, AIM will automatically scan supported assets and populate technology fingerprints such as:

- Web servers (Nginx, Apache, IIS)  
- Frameworks (React, Django, Laravel)  
- Programming languages  
- CDN or WAF providers  
- Cloud hosting signatures  

This helps security teams better understand the technical stack and map attack surface risk across environments.

##  How to Enable Tech Grabber

1. Navigate to **AIM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate **Tech Grabber** in the integrations list.  
3. Click **Install** to open the configuration modal.  
4. Confirm the installation — no API keys or credentials are required.  

Once installed, Tech Grabber begins analyzing assets automatically.

##  What Data It Collects

Tech Grabber enriches asset metadata with:

- Detected technologies & versions  
- Hosting providers / cloud fingerprints  
- Service banners and headers  
- Application stack attributes  

All discovered technology tags appear directly inside:

- Subdomain view  
- IP view  
- Application view  
- Technology Index  

---

##  How It Works Inside AIM

After installation:

- AIM scans each eligible asset during routine discovery cycles.  
- Technologies are extracted and attached to the asset record.  
- Tags such as `nginx`, `nodejs`, `cloudflare`, `wordpress`, etc., are added automatically.  
- New discoveries trigger updates in the Technology Index and asset views.

This ensures ongoing, automated technology identification with zero manual work.

##  Monitoring Enrichment Results

You can view technology data in:

- **Asset Details → Technologies section**  
- **Technology Index (AIM → Technologies)**  
- **Relations & service context inside IP / Domain views**  

This allows fast filtering, grouping, and risk analysis for specific tech stacks.

---

## Troubleshooting

**No technologies detected?**  
- Ensure the asset is reachable externally.  
- Some assets (internal-only systems) may not expose banners or headers.  

**Updates not appearing?**  
- Wait for the next enrichment cycle or refresh Tech Grabber via **Active Adapters**.
