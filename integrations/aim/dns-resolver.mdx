## Overview

The **DNS Resolver integration** allows AIM to query DNS records directly and ingest discovered subdomains into your asset inventory.  
This ensures continuous visibility into DNS-related assets, even if they are not present in third-party platforms.

AIM uses DNS resolution intelligence to enrich each discovered asset with metadata such as CNAMEs, A/AAAA records, and status indicators.

## What This Integration Does

- Resolves DNS records for domains you onboard into AIM  
- Identifies live, inactive, or shadowed subdomains  
- Fetches A, AAAA, CNAME, NS, and other DNS record types  
- Continuously updates changes when DNS modifications occur  

This enables accurate, real-time mapping of your organization’s DNS footprint.

## Data Pulled by DNS Resolver

| Data Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **A / AAAA Records** | Maps subdomains to IPs (IPv4/IPv6) |
| **CNAME Records** | Identifies alias mappings and CDN usage |
| **NS Records** | Shows authoritative name servers |
| **Live / Inactive State** | Detects active vs. dead subdomains |
| **Shadow DNS Entries** | Identifies DNS records not tracked internally |

---

## Sync Behavior

- DNS resolution runs **automatically** at regular intervals  
- Any new DNS-derived subdomain is added to AIM  
- Deleted or outdated DNS entries update the asset state  
- All resolved records are stored in the asset’s metadata panel
