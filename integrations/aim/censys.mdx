## Censys Integration with Snapsec AIM

The **Censys integration** allows AIM to automatically ingest internet-wide scan data related to your organization — including domains, subdomains, IPs, certificates, ports, and technologies.

Once connected, AIM continuously syncs Censys discovery results into your **Global Catalog**, ensuring full visibility into your external-facing asset footprint.

---

## Prerequisites

Before enabling this integration, you need:

- A **Censys Account**
- Your **API ID**
- Your **API Secret**
- One or more **root domains** or **organization identifiers** configured in AIM

> 🔐 Your API Secret behaves like a password — keep it secure and rotate regularly.

---

## Enable the Integration in AIM

1. Go to **AIM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate the **Censys** integration tile.  
3. Click **Install**.  
4. A configuration dialog will appear asking for:
   - **API ID**
   - **API Secret**

Fill in your credentials and click **Save & Connect**.

If authentication succeeds, AIM will begin pulling asset data immediately.

## What AIM Fetches from Censys

Once connected, AIM automatically imports:

### 🔍 **Domain & Subdomain Data**
- Newly discovered subdomains  
- Host associations  
- DNS records  
- Expanding external footprint

### 🌐 **IP & Network Intelligence**
- Public IP addresses  
- Open ports  
- Exposed services  
- Geo & ASN data  

### 🔒 **Certificate Insights**
- SSL certificate metadata  
- Certificate → domain relationships  
- Expired or mismatched certs  

### 🧩 **Technology Fingerprints**
- Web server signatures  
- Cloud provider metadata  
- Framework and stack identification

All discoveries enrich existing assets or create new ones in real time.

## How AIM Uses Censys Data

AIM automatically:

- Detects **external-facing assets**  
- Flags **exposures** such as open ports or public services  
- Updates **asset ownership**, **environment**, and **risk classification**  
- Correlates IPs/domains with existing vulnerabilities  
- Expands discovery for related assets (recursive enrichment)

This ensures your external attack surface remains fully mapped and monitored.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Fix |
|-------|----------------|------|
| ❌ Authentication Failed | Invalid API ID/Secret | Re-enter credentials and verify from Censys dashboard |
| ⚠️ No Assets Synced | No matching domains OR rate limits reached | Add root domains in AIM → ASM settings |
| ⏳ Slow Sync | Large external footprint | Allow the initial sync to complete, AIM processes assets in batches |

If issues persist, contact Snapsec Support with the integration job ID.
