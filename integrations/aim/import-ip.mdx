## Overview

The **Import IP Addresses** feature allows you to bulk-upload IP assets into AIM using a CSV file.  
This is useful when migrating from legacy systems, consolidating inventories, or onboarding externally provided IP lists.

## How It Works

AIM parses your CSV file and converts each row into an IP asset enriched with:

- IP address value  
- Exposure status (if available)  
- Owner or team information (if provided)  
- Tags or classifications  
- Detected-on timestamps  

Uploaded IPs immediately appear in your IP Catalog and become available for correlation with vulnerabilities, relationships, and risk scoring.

## CSV Format

Your CSV file should contain at least one column:

| Column | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **ip** | Yes | The IP address to be imported |

Optional columns include:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **owner** | Assigns an owner during import |
| **tags** | Comma-separated list of tags |
| **description** | Additional metadata about the IP |

## After Import

Once imported:

- IPs appear instantly in the **IP Catalog**
- Classifier rules may auto-assign owners, environments, or exposure status  
- IPs become eligible for vulnerability correlation from VM integrations  
- You can enrich them further via adapters (Tech Grabber, IPInfo, ASM, etc.)
