## Overview

The **Import IP Addresses** integration allows teams to bring large sets of IP assets into AIM using a simple CSV upload.  
This is useful when migrating from legacy systems, CMDB exports, scanner outputs, or manually maintained spreadsheets.

## How It Works

AIM accepts a structured CSV file containing IP-related metadata.  
Once uploaded, AIM automatically:

- Creates new IP asset records  
- Enriches each IP using adapters (IpInfo, TechGrabber, ASM, VM, etc.)  
- Assigns exposure, risk, and classification  
- Correlates IPs with existing assets where possible  

This ensures newly imported IPs instantly become part of the unified inventory.

## CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV must contain at least:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **ip** | The IP address to import (mandatory) |
| **owner** | Optional owner/team attribution |
| **tags** | Optional comma-separated tags |
| **source** | Optional description of where the IP came from |

Example:

```csv
ip,owner,tags,source
192.168.1.10,network-team,internal,legacy-cmdb
34.112.55.20,cloud-team,production,aws-export
