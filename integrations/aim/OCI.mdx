## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Integration for AIM

The **OCI integration** allows Asset Inventory Management (AIM) to automatically ingest cloud assets directly from your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure account.  
This ensures your cloud inventory stays complete, enriched, and continuously updated.

With OCI connected, AIM can fetch:

- Compute instances  
- Virtual networks (VCNs)  
- Subnets & IP addresses  
- Object storage buckets  
- Load balancers  
- DNS zones  
- Attached public resources  
- Network metadata & tags  

This eliminates manual exports and keeps your cloud asset footprint always accurate.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before configuring OCI in AIM, ensure you have:

- An **OCI account** with permissions to read cloud resources  
- **Tenancy OCID**  
- **User OCID**  
- **Compartment OCID** (root or specific compartment)  
- **API private key** + **Fingerprint**  
- **Region** (e.g., `us-ashburn-1`)  

AIM uses these credentials only to fetch read-only metadata.

## 2. Add OCI Integration in AIM

1. Navigate to **AIM → Integrations**  
2. Find **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure** in the adapter list  
3. Click **Install**  
4. A configuration modal will appear asking for:

   - Tenancy OCID  
   - User OCID  
   - Compartment OCID  
   - Fingerprint  
   - Private Key  
   - Region

</Frame>

After submitting, AIM will validate the credentials and begin syncing resources.

## 3. What AIM Collects from OCI

Once installed, AIM will automatically ingest and classify assets such as:

### **Compute Resources**
- VM Instances  
- Public / Private IPs  
- Instance states & tags  

### **Networking**
- VCNs  
- Subnets  
- Route tables  
- Security lists  
- Load Balancers  

### **Storage**
- Object storage buckets (public/private)  
- Bucket policies  

### **DNS**
- DNS zones  
- Records  
- Configurations

## 4. Refreshing & Updating OCI Data

AIM periodically refreshes OCI data automatically, but you can also:

- **Run manual resync**
- **Check Adapter Logs**
- **View recently added cloud assets**

All updates are visible in the **Adapter Activity Log**.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### **Invalid Credentials**
- Verify OCIDs, fingerprint, and private key  
- Ensure correct region  
- Ensure required IAM permissions

### **Missing Resources**
- Check if AIM has access to your selected compartment  
- Include root compartment to fetch all child compartments
