## CRT.sh Integration with Snapsec AIM

The **CRT.sh integration** allows Snapsec AIM to automatically fetch **subdomains** discovered through global Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.  
This helps identify hidden, forgotten, or shadow domains that appear in SSL certificates but are not tracked internally.

This guide explains how to:

1. Enable CRT integration in AIM  
2. Automatically import subdomains from CT logs  
3. Use the fetched data for inventory, threat analysis, and discovery  

---

## 1. Prerequisites

CRT.sh does **not require API keys** — only a domain or organization keyword to search.

You will need:

- A registered domain (e.g., `example.com`)  
- Permission to manage AIM adapters  
- (Optional) Asset classification rules to tag imported assets  

---

## 2. Installing the CRT Integration

1. Go to **AIM → Integrations**  
2. Find **CRT** in the integrations list  
3. Click **Install**  

A dialog will appear prompting you to configure:

- **Domain / Root Domain** (required)  
- **Polling Interval** (optional, default daily)  

Click **Save** once complete.

## 3. How CRT.sh Discovery Works

Once enabled, Snapsec AIM will:

### 🔍 Query CT Logs
Search CRT.sh for any certificate containing:

- Your domain  
- Subdomains  
- Wildcard certificates  
- Historical certificates  

### 🧩 Parse Certificate Records
AIM processes certificate CN/SAN entries to extract:

- Subdomain names  
- Wildcard domain variants  
- Past domains still visible in public logs  

### 🔗 Add New Assets to Inventory
Imported subdomains appear in:

- **Subdomains Catalog**  
- **Global Asset Inventory**  
- Asset Relations Graph  
- Exposure analysis workflows  

Each subdomain is enriched with:

- DNS lookups  
- Technologies  
- IP mapping  
- Risk Indicators

## 4. How AIM Uses CRT Data

CRT integration helps solve several real problems:

### ✔ Identify Shadow Subdomains  
Discover subdomains created without security approval but exposed publicly.

### ✔ Detect Legacy or Forgotten Environments  
Old certificates reveal deprecated services still reachable online.

### ✔ Strengthen Surface Monitoring  
New certificate issuance immediately alerts AIM to newly exposed assets.

### ✔ Enhance ASM + VM + TM Workflows  
CRT-derived domains automatically flow into:

- Vulnerability scans  
- Threat modeling projects  
- Attack surface maps  

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### ❗ No subdomains found  
Ensure your root domain is correctly entered (e.g., `example.com`, not `https://example.com`).

### ❗ Too many results or noise  
Use AIM classifiers to tag or filter unwanted entries.

### ❗ Duplicate records  
AIM automatically deduplicates assets — duplicates will merge into a single asset entry.
