## CRT Integration with Snapsec AIM

**CRT (Certificate Transparency)** integration allows Snapsec AIM to automatically detect newly issued SSL/TLS certificates for your domains in real time.  
This helps security teams uncover:

- Newly registered subdomains  
- Shadow infrastructure  
- Suspicious or malicious certificate issuance  
- Certificate lifecycle & expiration gaps  

Snapsec continuously monitors CRT logs and imports certificate records directly into the **Certificate Catalog** and **Subdomain Catalog** in AIM.

---

## 1. What This Integration Does

Once CRT integration is enabled:

<Check> Automatically monitors global Certificate Transparency logs </Check>  
<Check> Detects certificates issued for your domains or wildcard domains </Check>  
<Check> Extracts SAN entries, issuer, validity period, and fingerprints </Check>  
<Check> Creates or updates certificates inside AIM’s **Certificate Catalog** </Check>  
<Check> Automatically discovers new subdomains found inside certificates </Check>  

CRT acts as an external discovery mechanism for detecting assets **before attackers do**.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

You only need:

- One or more **root domains** added in AIM  
- CRT monitoring enabled (AIM → Integrations → CRT)  
- No API key or external configuration required — CRT is a public data source  

AIM will begin polling certificate logs automatically.

## 3. How CRT Discovery Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor Transparency Logs" icon="eye">
    AIM monitors global CT logs (Google, Cloudflare, DigiCert, Let’s Encrypt, etc.) continuously.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Match Detected Certificates" icon="link">
    Any certificate containing your domain (e.g., `*.example.com`, `api.example.com`) is captured.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Parse SAN & Metadata" icon="magnifying-glass">
    AIM extracts SAN records, issuer, validity dates, fingerprints, and signatures.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create or Update Assets" icon="plus">
    Certificates are added to the Certificate Catalog, and new subdomains are auto-created.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 4. Example CRT Output Imported by AIM

A typical certificate imported from CT logs includes:

- **Common Name:** `api.example.com`  
- **SANs:** `api.example.com`, `internal-api.example.com`  
- **Issuer:** Let’s Encrypt  
- **Valid From / To:** 2025-01-01 → 2025-03-31  
- **Fingerprint:** SHA256 hash  
- **Auto-Discovered Subdomains:** `internal-api.example.com`

AIM automatically associates these with the correct domain and risk profile.

## 7. No Webhook or CI Needed

Unlike scanners or code analysis tools, CRT does **not** require:

- CI/CD steps  
- API keys  
- Repo access  
- Webhooks  

AIM handles everything automatically.
