## Snapsec Secret Scanner Integration with AIM

The **Snapsec Secret Scanner** integration allows AIM to ingest secrets, exposed credentials, tokens, and other sensitive findings detected inside your code repositories.

This integration helps centralize **secret exposure risks** inside your asset inventory, linking each detected secret back to:

- The repository  
- File path  
- Commit or branch  
- Secret type  
- Risk score  

AIM then enriches these results with ownership, environment classification, and exposure context.

---

## Prerequisites

Before enabling this integration, ensure you have:

- Access to **Snapsec Secret Scanner**.  
- A valid **API key** for secret-scan exports.  
- Code repositories already scanned by Snapsec Secret Scanner (GitHub / GitLab / other repo sources).  
- AIM workspace permissions that allow integration installation.

---

## Enable the Integration

1. Go to **AIM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate **Snapsec Secret Scanner** in the integrations list.  
3. Click **Install**.  
4. Enter:
   - **API Key** from Snapsec Secret Scanner  
   - (Optional) Repository identifiers or any workspace-specific config  
5. Click **Save & Connect**.

Once connected, AIM will begin receiving secret exposure results.

##  What This Integration Imports

AIM will import and map:

- Secret type (API keys, tokens, credentials, service keys, etc.)  
- Repository details (name, owner, provider)  
- Affected file paths  
- Commit metadata  
- Risk scoring and classification  
- Detection timelines  

Each imported secret becomes an **asset-linked risk record** inside AIM.

---

##  Sync Behavior

- AIM checks Snapsec Secret Scanner periodically for new findings.  
- Newly detected secrets are added automatically.  
- Fixed / removed secrets can be marked as resolved.  
- Repository ownership is auto-linked using AIM’s classifier engine.  

---

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid API Key  
Ensure the API key is active and correctly copied.

### No Data Appearing  
Confirm your repositories were successfully scanned in **Snapsec Secret Scanner**.

### Mapping Issues  
Check classifier rules for repository ownership or tagging.
