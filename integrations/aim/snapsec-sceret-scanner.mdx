## Overview

The **Vulnerability Management Integration** allows AIM to automatically sync vulnerability information from Snapsec VM and enrich asset records with live security context.

Once enabled, assets inside AIM — such as IPs, domains, APIs, repositories, and applications — are automatically correlated with vulnerabilities discovered inside Snapsec VM.

## What This Integration Does

- Pulls vulnerability metadata from Snapsec VM into AIM  
- Links vulnerabilities with corresponding assets (IP, domain, repository, API, etc.)  
- Updates severity counts, risk scores, and exposure status in real time  
- Ensures asset records remain consistent with the VM module  
- Enables unified investigation across asset and vulnerability views  

AIM does not modify vulnerabilities — it **consumes** VM data to keep your asset inventory enriched and accurate.

## How to Enable the Integration

1. Go to **AIM → Integrations**  
2. Locate **Vulnerability Management**  
3. Click **Install / Configure**  
4. Enter your **Snapsec API Key**  
5. Save and enable the integration  

AIM will immediately begin syncing vulnerability information associated with any asset.

## Synced Data

AIM automatically retrieves:

- Vulnerability titles & descriptions  
- Severity (Critical / High / Medium / Low / Info)  
- Detection timestamps  
- Affected assets  
- Source scanner  
- VM lifecycle state (Open, In Review, Resolved, etc.)  

This enables AIM to compute accurate **asset-level risk**, **exposure**, and **security score**.

## Viewing Vulnerabilities in AIM

Once the integration is active, each asset page includes:

- Vulnerability count  
- Severity breakdown  
- Linked vulnerability list  
- Quick navigation to the VM module

## Sync Behavior

- Sync is **continuous** and automatically updates when:
  - New vulnerabilities appear in VM  
  - Vulnerabilities change state  
  - Resolved vulnerabilities are closed  
- No manual refresh is required  
- AIM only reads data — it does not modify VM records  

---

## Troubleshooting

- **No vulnerabilities appearing:**  
  Ensure the same assets exist in both AIM and VM.
- **API key invalid:**  
  Regenerate and re-enter your Snapsec VM API key.
- **Stale data:**  
  Check integration status under **AIM → Integrations → Vulnerability Management**.
