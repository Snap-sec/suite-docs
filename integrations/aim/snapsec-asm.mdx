## Overview

The **Snapsec ASM Integration** allows AIM to automatically ingest assets discovered on your external attack surface — including domains, subdomains, IPs, exposed services, cloud endpoints, and shadow infrastructure.

This integration ensures that everything visible to attackers externally also becomes visible internally to your security and asset teams.

## What This Integration Does

Once enabled, AIM begins receiving assets from your ASM workspace:

- Newly discovered domains & subdomains  
- Shadow IT assets  
- External IPs and open ports  
- Cloud-exposed resources  
- High-risk or misconfigured assets  
- Exposure intelligence linked with vulnerabilities  

AIM merges these findings with your internal catalog, eliminating blind spots between ASM and internal IT.

## How to Configure

### 1. Open the Snapsec ASM Adapter  
Go to **AIM → Integrations → Snapsec ASM → Install**.

### 2. Provide Required Credentials  
Enter:

- **ASM Workspace ID**  
- **API Key** (from your ASM settings)  

Click **Install** to activate the connection.

### 3. AIM Begins Sync Automatically  
Once installed:

- New ASM discoveries appear under relevant asset types  
- Exposure metadata and relationships update in real time  
- Shadow assets become visible across AIM dashboards  

---

## Fields Imported from ASM

AIM will ingest metadata such as:

- Asset value (domain, subdomain, IP, API, etc.)  
- Exposure type (Exposed, Shadow, Safe)  
- Severity & risk indicators  
- Open ports / services  
- First & last seen timestamps  
- Technology fingerprints  
- Associated ASN / cloud metadata  

---

## Sync Frequency

ASM → AIM sync runs **continuously**, and most updates appear within seconds of being discovered.

---

## When to Use This Integration

Enable Snapsec ASM in AIM if you want:

- External attack surface assets visible in your internal inventory  
- Unified vulnerability & exposure analysis  
- Shadow asset detection mapped to owners  
- Cross-module correlation between AIM, ASM, and VM
