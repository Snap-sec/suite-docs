## Overview

The **Import Employees** integration allows you to bulk-upload employee identities into AIM using a simple CSV file.  
This is useful when sourcing employee data from HR systems, IAM exports, or manual records.

## How It Works

AIM processes each row in the CSV and converts it into an employee identity with:

- Email  
- Vendor / provider  
- Tags  
- Internal / external classification  
- Activity metadata  
- Ownership mapping  

Uploaded identities become part of the Employee Directory and can be enriched through other AIM adapters.

## CSV Requirements

Your CSV must include at least:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **email** | Employee’s primary identity |
| **vendor** | Associated provider (e.g., Gmail, Slack, Microsoft) |
| **type** | Internal or external |
| **tags** | Optional metadata |

AIM automatically validates the structure before saving entries.
