## Cloudflare integration with Snapsec AIM

The **Cloudflare integration** allows AIM to automatically discover and sync DNS records, subdomains, IP addresses, and related metadata from your Cloudflare-managed zones.

This enables continuous asset discovery, real-time updates, and accurate inventory management without manual uploads.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before connecting Cloudflare to Snapsec AIM, ensure you have:

- A Cloudflare account with access to at least one zone.
- A **Cloudflare API Token** with required permissions.
- Zone access level:  
  - **Zone → Read**  
  - **DNS → Read**  
  - (Optional) **Account → Read** for additional metadata.

### Create a Cloudflare API Token

1. Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard.  
2. Navigate to **My Profile → API Tokens**.  
3. Click **Create Token**.  
4. Choose **Read permissions template** or create a custom token.  
5. Required permissions:
   - `Zone: Read`
   - `DNS: Read`
   - (Optional) `Account: Read`
6. Select the zones you want AIM to sync.  
7. Create and copy the token.

> ⚠️ Store this token securely. It will be used only inside Snapsec AIM.

## 2. Connecting Cloudflare in Snapsec AIM

1. Go to **AIM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate **Cloudflare** and click **Install**.  
3. Enter the required fields:
   - **Email** (Cloudflare account email)
   - **API Token**
4. Click **Install** or **Connect** to verify the connection.

After successful authentication, AIM will begin syncing DNS and asset data from Cloudflare.

## 3. What AIM imports from Cloudflare

Once connected, AIM automatically fetches:

- All DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, NS, etc.)
- Associated **subdomains**
- Cloudflare-provided metadata
- Linked IP addresses
- Exposure classification
- Zones and hosting attributes

AIM updates the data continuously based on adapter refresh cycles.

---

## 4. Sync Behavior

### Automatic Sync  
AIM periodically:
- Refreshes DNS records  
- Detects new subdomains  
- Identifies removed or inactive entries  
- Updates risk and exposure calculations  

### Manual Sync  
You can trigger a refresh from the **Active Adapters** menu.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Invalid token** → Regenerate your token with correct permissions.  
- **No zones appearing** → Ensure the token is scoped to specific zones.  
- **Partial data** → Check DNS permissions and verify zone access.  

If errors persist, contact Snapsec support with the request ID shown in the UI.
