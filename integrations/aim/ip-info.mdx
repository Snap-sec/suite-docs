This integration enhances asset context by adding ASN data, geolocation, hosting information, and network ownership attributes.

## What This Integration Does

Once enabled, the IP Info automatically:

- Enriches every discovered IP with **ASN number, organization, and network block**  
- Adds **geolocation data** such as country, region, and city  
- Identifies **hosting providers, cloud networks, and ISP details**  
- Improves **risk scoring** with exposure-aware metadata  
- Helps classify external vs internal IP behavior  

This enrichment is applied continuously as new IPs appear in AIM.
