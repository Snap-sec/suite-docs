## Overview

The **Slack integration** allows AIM to automatically ingest and synchronize employee identities from your Slack workspace.  
This keeps your asset inventory up to date with accurate user information, including active members, deactivated accounts, and associated metadata.

## What This Integration Does

- Fetches employee accounts from your Slack workspace  
- Updates AIM with identity details such as:
  - Name  
  - Email  
  - Account status (active / disabled)  
  - User type (internal / external)  
- Keeps employee records synchronized on each refresh  
- Supports continuous monitoring of user identity drift across your organization

## How to Connect Slack

1. Navigate to **AIM → Integrations**.  
2. Select **Slack** from the integration list.  
3. Click **Install** to begin setup.  
4. Approve Slack authentication and grant required permissions.  
5. AIM will automatically sync employee identities after connection.

---

## Permissions Required

Slack requires read-only access to:
- Workspace users  
- Basic profile fields  
- User email addresses (if available)  

AIM never modifies Slack data — it only imports identity information.

---

## Sync Behavior

After installation, AIM:
- Performs an immediate initial sync  
- Updates employee data on each scheduled or manual refresh  
- Tracks changes such as new hires, deactivated accounts, and external collaborators  

You can view all synced employees inside the **Employee Directory**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authorization error** → Reconnect Slack to refresh tokens  
- **Missing email addresses** → Some Slack plans restrict email visibility  
- **Users not appearing** → Ensure they are not restricted or guest members
