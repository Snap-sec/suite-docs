## Slack Integration with Snapsec

Snapsec supports **native Slack integration** to deliver instant notifications for vulnerabilities, exposures, scan results, threat updates, and workflow events — directly into your team’s Slack channels.

This guide walks you through:

1. Creating a Slack App for incoming webhooks  
2. Connecting Slack to Snapsec  
3. Choosing what alerts you want delivered  
4. Testing and validating the integration  

You do **not** need prior experience with Slack app setup — everything is step-by-step.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before integrating Slack with Snapsec, ensure you have:

- A Slack workspace  
- Permission to create a Slack App or Incoming Webhook  
- A Snapsec account with admin access  
- The Slack **Webhook URL** for the channel you want notifications sent to

## 2. Create a Slack Incoming Webhook

Follow these steps to create the webhook Slack will use to receive alerts:

1. Visit: https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks  
2. Click **Create an App** → “From scratch”  
3. Name the app (example: `Snapsec Alerts`)  
4. Choose your workspace  
5. Under **Incoming Webhooks**, enable *Activate Incoming Webhooks*  
6. Click **Add New Webhook**  
7. Select a channel (example: `#security-alerts`)  
8. Copy the generated **Webhook URL**

You will paste this URL into Snapsec.

## 3. Configure Slack Integration in Snapsec

1. Go to **Snapsec → Settings → Integrations → Slack**  
2. Click **Add Slack Webhook**  
3. Paste the **Webhook URL** you copied earlier  
4. Choose the event types you want Slack to receive:

### Supported Event Types

- 🔥 **New Vulnerability Detected**  
- 🛠️ **Remediation Completed**  
- ⚠️ **Critical Exposure Found**  
- 🧪 **Scan Completed**  
- 🧵 **Threat Model Updated**  
- 👤 **Owner Assigned / Changed**  
- 📉 **SLA Breach Alerts**  

5. Save the integration

Snapsec will immediately begin sending alerts for the selected categories.

## 4. Test the Slack Integration

In Snapsec:

1. Click **Test Connection**  
2. Snapsec sends a sample alert to your Slack channel  
3. You should see a message like:

> **Snapsec Alert Test**  
> Your Slack integration is working correctly.

If nothing appears:

- Recheck the webhook URL  
- Ensure the Slack channel permissions allow bot messages  
- Validate internet restrictions or firewall rules
