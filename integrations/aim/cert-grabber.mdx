## Cert Grabber integration with Snapsec AIM

The **Cert Grabber** integration enhances your asset inventory by retrieving SSL/TLS certificate metadata from each discovered subdomain.

This helps detect:
- Expired certificates  
- Weak encryption  
- Misconfigured certificate chains  
- Certificate reuse issues  

---

## 1. How It Works

Once enabled, AIM will:

- Scan discovered subdomains  
- Fetch certificate details, including:
  - Issuer  
  - Expiry date  
  - SAN entries  
  - Signature algorithm  
  - Public key info  
- Map certificates to:
  - Subdomains  
  - Services  
  - Technology fingerprints  

---

## 2. Enabling the Integration

1. Navigate to **AIM → Integrations**  
2. Select **Cert Grabber**  
3. Click **Install**  

No API key is needed.

---

## 3. What AIM Enriches

- Automatically flags:
  - Expired certificates  
  - Soon-to-expire certificates  
  - Weak or deprecated algorithms  
- Creates certificate entries under **AIM → Certificates**

---

## Troubleshooting

**No certificates found:**  
Subdomain may not resolve or may not support HTTPS.

**Duplicate certificates:**  
AIM deduplicates based on fingerprint.
