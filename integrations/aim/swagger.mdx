## Overview

The **Swagger Integration** allows AIM to automatically ingest and update API definitions using uploaded or linked Swagger (OpenAPI) specifications.  
This keeps your API catalog accurate, enriched, and continuously aligned with engineering changes.

## What This Integration Does

With Swagger connected, AIM can:

- Parse OpenAPI/Swagger files (`.json` or `.yaml`)
- Discover all API endpoints, methods, parameters, and structures
- Automatically create or update API assets in AIM
- Maintain version-accurate and up-to-date API inventories
- Detect additions or removals when new specs are uploaded

This integration is ideal for teams whose API definitions live in Postman, SwaggerHub, API Gateway exports, or local repositories.

## How to Connect Swagger to AIM

###  Open the Swagger Integration

1. Navigate to **AIM → Integrations**  
2. Locate **Swagger**  
3. Click **Install**

You will see the upload/import dialog.

###  Provide Your Swagger Definition

You can connect Swagger in two ways:

#### **Option A — Upload a Swagger/OpenAPI File**
Upload a `.json` or `.yaml` file exported from:

- SwaggerHub  
- Postman  
- API Gateway  
- Internal API documentation tools  

#### **Option B — Import Through URL**
Paste a public or authenticated Swagger spec URL.

AIM will fetch the schema and begin API discovery.

## How AIM Processes Swagger Data

After import, AIM:

- Parses paths, operations, tags, and schemas  
- Builds API endpoint entries in the API Catalog  
- Classifies endpoints and applies default tagging  
- Maps metadata like parameters, servers, content types, and security settings  
- Updates existing APIs if the spec has changed  

This ensures AIM always reflects the *current, real API surface*.

---

## Managing Swagger Imports

Swagger imports can be:

- **Re-uploaded** to update an API set  
- **Scheduled** (if using a URL source)  
- **Refreshed** on demand  

When a new version is uploaded, AIM automatically:

- Adds newly introduced endpoints  
- Flags removed endpoints  
- Updates definitions, schemas, and metadata  

---

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and resolutions:

- **Spec not parsing**: Ensure the file is valid OpenAPI 2.0 / 3.x format  
- **Missing endpoints**: Check if the paths are defined under `paths:` in the spec  
- **Private URL failing**: Confirm authentication headers or tokens are configured  

If you continue experiencing issues, share the spec file with Snapsec Support for validation.
