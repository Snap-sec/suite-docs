## Overview

The **GitHub integration for AIM** allows you to automatically pull repository information, metadata, ownership data, and associated assets directly into your Asset Inventory.  
This ensures your development ecosystem remains continuously monitored, up-to-date, and accurately attributed.

## What This Integration Does

With GitHub connected, AIM can:

- Discover repositories under your organization  
- Sync repository metadata such as description, visibility, and activity  
- Track associated technologies, owners, and tags  
- Enrich AIM’s asset catalog with GitHub-origin assets  
- Keep repository inventory updated automatically through adapter syncs  

This eliminates manual tracking and ensures developers and security teams have a shared, accurate source of truth.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring GitHub, ensure you have:

- A GitHub **organization** or **user account**  
- A GitHub **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the required scopes  
- AIM workspace access with integration permissions  

### Required GitHub scopes

Your PAT must include:

- `repo` — to read repositories  
- `read:org` — to fetch organization membership  
- `admin:repo_hook` *(optional)* — if enabling webhook-based syncs

## Sync Behavior

After installation:

- AIM pulls repository lists and metadata  
- Repository changes are synced periodically via adapters  
- Deletions or inactivity are flagged for lifecycle review  
- Asset relations for repos (employees, technologies, exposure, etc.) are updated continuously  

---

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid token  
- Ensure your PAT includes the correct scopes  
- Confirm the token has not expired or been revoked  

### Organization not visible  
- The PAT-linked user must be a member of the organization  
- Check GitHub org SSO requirements  

### No repositories syncing  
- Ensure the selected visibility settings (private/public) match your repos  
- Verify the integration run logs under **Adapters → Logs**
