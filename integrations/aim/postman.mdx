## Postman Integration with Snapsec API Security

Use **Postman Collections** as a source of truth for your API definitions and automatically sync them into Snapsec API Security (APIGuard).  
This enables continuous API scanning, fuzzing, and threat analysis — without manually rebuilding your API catalog.

This guide shows you, step by step, how to:

1. Export a Postman Collection  
2. Import it into Snapsec via the **Postman Adapter**  
3. Enable automatic syncing for continuous API discovery  
4. Start API scans and fuzz testing from the imported collection  

---

## 1. Why Integrate Postman?

Most engineering teams rely on Postman for:

- API documentation  
- Test collections  
- Environment management  
- Collaboration between backend & frontend teams  

Snapsec extends these workflows by:

- Converting Postman requests into structured API endpoints  
- Automatically mapping methods, auth, headers, and parameters  
- Generating threats, test cases, and fuzz scenarios  
- Continuously monitoring the API for weaknesses  

---

## 2. Export Your Postman Collection

In Postman:

1. Open the Collection  
2. Click **… (options)**  
3. Select **Export**  
4. Choose **Collection v2.1**  
5. Download the `.json` file  

You will upload this file to Snapsec in the next step.

---

## 3. Import Postman Collection into Snapsec

Snapsec supports two ways to import:

### **A. Manual Upload**

1. Navigate to **API Security → Integrations → Postman**  
2. Click **Upload Collection**  
3. Select your exported `.json` file  
4. Choose the project where APIs will be stored  
5. Confirm import  

Snapsec automatically extracts:

- Endpoints  
- Methods  
- Headers  
- Auth tokens  
- Path & query parameters  
- Collections → Groups mapping  

---

### **B. Automatic Sync (Recommended)**

If you store Postman collections on:

- Postman Cloud  
- GitHub  
- GitLab  
- Bitbucket  

Snapsec can **auto-sync** the collection using a webhook or integration token.

Supported auto-sync modes:

- On file change (Git repo)
- On Postman Collection update
- Scheduled sync (hourly / daily)

---

## 4. Start API Scanning From Imported Endpoints

Once imported, APIs appear in your **API Catalog**.

From here, you can:

- Run **Active Scans**
- Enable **Continuous Fuzzing**
- Generate **Threat Scenarios**
- Perform **Auth Weakness Detection**
- Detect **Misconfigurations**  
- Map **API relationships** and **risk scores**

Each imported API is automatically normalized and enriched with:

- Auth profiles  
- Environment variables  
- Execution history  
- Parameter typing  
- Vulnerability findings  

---

## 5. Example: Using Postman Environments

Snapsec supports variable injection similar to Postman.

Your Postman environment values will be mapped into:

- Snapsec **Environment Variables**  
- Snapsec **Scan Profiles**  

This enables environment-specific scanning like:

- `dev.api.example.com`
- `staging.api.example.com`
- `prod.api.example.com`

---

## 6. API Security Automation Workflow

Once Postman is integrated:

### Snapsec automatically:

- Converts requests → standardized endpoints  
- Detects new endpoints added to the collection  
- Flags deleted/changed endpoints  
- Identifies sensitive endpoints  
- Generates threat models  
- Runs security tests continuously  

Your Postman collection becomes your **API source of truth**, and Snapsec becomes your **security engine**.

## Example Webhook for Auto-Sync

If using GitHub or Postman Cloud:

```bash
POST https://suite.snapsec.co/apiguard/import/postman/<project-id>
Headers:
  x-api-key: <your-api-key>
Body:
  <JSON collection>
