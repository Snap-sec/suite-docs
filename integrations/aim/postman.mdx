## Postman integration with Snapsec VM

Use the **Postman integration** to automatically send API test results or exported Postman Collections into Snapsec VM for vulnerability parsing, API discovery, and assessment-level organization.

This integration allows security teams to reuse existing Postman workflows while enriching Snapsec VM with structured API data and security insights.

---

##  Prerequisites

Before integrating Postman with Snapsec VM, ensure you have:

- A Postman workspace with one or more **Collections**.  
- Ability to export a Postman Collection (v2.1 recommended).  
- Snapsec VM:
  - **Assessment ID** for storing imported API requests.
  - **API Key** for authentication.
- Optional: Postman API key (if using automated sync via Postman API).

You can use this integration manually (file upload) or automatically (Postman API).

## Import Postman Collections into Snapsec VM

Snapsec VM supports 2 modes:

### **Mode A — Manual Upload (Simplest Method)**

1. In Postman, open the collection.  
2. Click **… → Export**.  
3. Choose **Collection v2.1**.  
4. Save the JSON file locally.

Now upload it to Snapsec VM:

1. In Snapsec, go to **VM → Integrations**.  
2. Select **Postman** → **Upload Collection**.  
3. Choose the exported `.json` file.  
4. Select the **Assessment** where requests should be imported.  
5. Click **Import**.

Snapsec will:

- Parse all API requests  
- Extract endpoints and methods  
- Identify authentication patterns  
- Detect potential vulnerabilities using built-in rules  
- Populate the API catalog inside VM  

---

### **Mode B — Automated Sync (Using Postman API)**

If you prefer continuous imports:

1. Go to Postman: **Settings → API Keys → Generate API Key**.  
2. Copy the key.  

In Snapsec:

1. Open **VM → Integrations → Postman**.  
2. Enter:
   - **Postman API Key**
   - **Collection UID**
   - **Workspace ID** (optional, depending on configuration)
3. Click **Connect**.

Snapsec will periodically fetch updates from Postman and re-import new or changed requests.

##  How Snapsec Processes Postman Collections

Once imported, Snapsec automatically:

- Extracts all REST, GraphQL, and SOAP requests  
- Maps endpoints to assets  
- Identifies sensitive parameters  
- Detects authentication or authorization patterns  
- Flags potential misconfigurations or risky request flows  
- Populates API data into:
  - **Assessments**
  - **API Catalog**
  - **Vulnerability Scanner (if connected)**  

Combined with scanning engines, this creates a complete API security workflow.

##  Troubleshooting

- **Collection not importing?**  
  Ensure the file is exported as **Postman Collection v2.1**.

- **Incorrect endpoints displayed?**  
  Some workflows require setting the correct Postman environment during export.

- **Auth values missing?**  
  Snapsec only imports authentication if included in the file (check “export with values”).

- **Sync failing via Postman API?**  
  - Validate Postman API key  
  - Verify Collection UID  
  - Ensure Postman workspace permissions  

If issues continue, share the request ID with Snapsec support.
