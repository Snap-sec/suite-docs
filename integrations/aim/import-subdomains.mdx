## Import Subdomains into AIM

The **Import Subdomains** integration allows you to upload a CSV file containing subdomain records and instantly populate your Asset Inventory.  
This is useful when migrating from legacy systems, importing recon data, or manually maintaining internal inventories.

---

##  Prerequisites

Before importing:

- Prepare a valid **CSV file** containing subdomains.
- Ensure each row includes at least the **subdomain value**.
- Optional fields may include:
  - Tags  
  - Owner  
  - Environment  
  - Notes  

---

##  Access the Import Interface

1. Open Snapsec Suite.  
2. Navigate to: **AIM → Integrations**.  
3. Locate **Import Subdomains**.  
4. Click **Import** to open the upload dialog.

---

##  Upload Your CSV

You will see a modal with an upload field.

- Click **Upload File** and select your CSV.
- AIM will parse and validate the structure.
- Any formatting issues will be shown before import.

Once validated, click **Import Now**.

##  How AIM Processes the Import

After uploading:

- AIM creates or updates subdomain assets automatically.
- Each imported asset is enriched by:
  - Classifier rules
  - Ownership mappings
  - Environment detection
  - Exposure analysis (if adapters are active)

Imported assets immediately appear in the **Subdomains Catalog**.

---

##  Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect CSV format** → Ensure headers are correct.  
- **Duplicates not updating** → Existing subdomains are matched by value.  
- **Ownership not applied** → Check classifier rules in AIM.
