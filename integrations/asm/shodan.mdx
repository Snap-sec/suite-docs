## Shodan integration with Snapsec ASM

The **Shodan integration** allows Snapsec ASM to automatically enrich your external attack surface with intelligence gathered from Shodan’s global internet scan data.

Once connected, ASM can fetch:

- Open ports and exposed services  
- Service banners & fingerprints  
- Detected technologies  
- Host metadata (ISP, organization, tags)  
- Exposure indicators discovered by Shodan  

This provides deeper context for identifying high-risk internet-facing assets.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling the integration, ensure you have:

- A **Shodan API Key**  
- An active Snapsec **ASM workspace**  
- Internet access from the Snapsec backend to `api.shodan.io`

> Shodan API keys can be generated from your Shodan account dashboard under **Account → API Keys**.

## 2. Enable the Shodan Integration in Snapsec ASM

1. Navigate to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate the **Shodan** integration tile.  
3. Click **Install** (or **Configure** if already added).  

A configuration dialog will appear requesting:

- **API Key**  
- Optional: request frequency or Shodan lookup limits depending on your plan.

Enter your **Shodan API Key**, then click **Install Now**.

If valid, the integration status will update to **Connected**.

## 3. How ASM uses Shodan data

When enabled, ASM performs the following automatically:

### 🔍 Enriches Discovered Hosts  
Whenever ASM finds an external IP or domain, it queries Shodan for:

- Exposed ports  
- Service versions  
- TLS/SSL info  
- Technology signatures  
- Banner metadata  
- CVE mappings (when available)

### ⚠️ Surface-Level Risk Indicators  
Shodan-derived risk attributes include:

- Services flagged as dangerous (RDP, Telnet, Elasticsearch, etc.)  
- Deprecated protocols  
- Known exploitable service versions  

### 🔗 Correlation with ASM Exposure Engine  
Shodan results are merged with:

- Snapsec exposure detections  
- Internal scan results  
- DNS + port mapping  
- Asset classification rules  

This gives a unified and more accurate risk profile.

## 4. Viewing Shodan Data in Asset Views

Once the integration is active, each IP/domain page may show additional fields:

- **Open Ports (Shodan)**  
- **Service Banners**  
- **Technologies Identified**  
- **ISP & ASN Information**  
- **Exposed Protocols**  
- **Risk Signals from Shodan**

These appear under the **Exposures**, **Ports**, or **Technologies** sections depending on the data type.

## 5. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Fix |
|-------|----------------|------|
| Invalid API key | Wrong key or expired Shodan plan | Regenerate key and retry |
| No data returned | Shodan has not scanned the host yet | Retry later or upgrade Shodan plan |
| Rate limit errors | Free-tier API limit exceeded | Increase plan or reduce query frequency |
