## Snapsec AIM integration with Snapsec ASM

The **Snapsec AIM integration** allows Snapsec ASM to automatically push all discovered external assets — such as domains, subdomains, IPs, technologies, exposures, and certificates — into **Snapsec Asset Inventory Management (AIM)**.  
This ensures your internal CMDB and inventory stay continuously updated with real attack surface discoveries.

---

## 1. What this integration does

Once enabled, ASM will automatically:

- Sync newly discovered **domains & subdomains** into AIM  
- Push **IP addresses**, **ports**, and **cloud resources** if detected  
- Update **technologies**, **exposure state**, and **risk metadata**  
- Enrich existing AIM assets with ASM discovery data  
- Ensure AIM reflects real-world, external-facing asset changes  

This creates a single source of truth between ASM and AIM.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

You only need:

- An active **Snapsec AIM workspace**
- API permissions (automatically handled inside Suite — no tokens required)
- ASM discovery data available for sync

No manual configuration or API keys are required inside ASM.

---

## 3. How to enable the integration

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**  
2. Find **Snapsec AIM**  
3. Click **Install**  
4. ASM will immediately begin syncing new discoveries into AIM  

Once installed, the integration appears as **Active**.

## 4. What data is synced into AIM

ASM sends the following asset categories into AIM:

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Domains & Subdomains** | All discovered hostnames, including wildcard findings |
| **IP Addresses** | Resolved IPs and infrastructure-level details |
| **Ports & Services** | Open ports, service fingerprints, and exposure tags |
| **Technologies** | Tech stack fingerprints from scanners & passive sources |
| **Certificates** | SSL/TLS certificate metadata discovered during recon |
| **Exposures** | Public exposures detected by ASM (e.g., open ports, weak DNS, etc.) |

AIM automatically correlates and merges this data with its existing inventory.

---

## 5. Sync Behavior

### **Automatic & Continuous Sync**
ASM pushes new assets or updated properties into AIM as soon as they are discovered.

### **Deduplication**
If AIM already contains the asset, ASM updates it rather than creating duplicates.

### **Metadata Enrichment**
Tags, risk indicators, and exposure classifications from ASM are ported into AIM.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Not seeing assets in AIM?**  
  Ensure ASM discovery scans have completed.

- **Duplicate assets in AIM?**  
  AIM’s classifier rules may group items differently; review your classifier config.

- **Technologies not syncing?**  
  Verify that Tech Grabber or other tech-detection sources are active in ASM.

If issues persist, contact Snapsec support.
