## Cloudflare Integration with Snapsec ASM

The **Cloudflare adapter** lets ASM automatically ingest DNS records, subdomains, and exposure data directly from your Cloudflare-managed zones.

This ensures your externally facing infrastructure remains fully mapped and monitored.

---

## 1. What Cloudflare Integration Does

ASM automatically collects:

- Domain & subdomain lists  
- DNS records (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, NS, SRV)  
- Cloudflare-managed IPs and mappings  
- Zone configuration metadata  
- Security/exposure details such as proxy status  

This helps maintain an accurate, up-to-date external attack surface.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

You will need:

- A **Cloudflare API Token**  
- Permissions:
  - **Zone: Read**
  - **DNS: Read**

You can generate a token from:

**Cloudflare → My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token**

---

## 3. Installing the Integration

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**  
2. Select **Cloudflare**  
3. Enter your **API Token**  
4. Click **Install Now**

Once verified, ASM begins fetching Cloudflare asset data.

## 4. What Data Gets Imported

Cloudflare → ASM data includes:

- All DNS records  
- Subdomains  
- Cloudflare-origin IPs  
- Zone metadata  
- DNS exposure insights  

Every imported asset is mapped into ASM’s **Asset Catalog** with classification and exposure details.

---

## 5. Sync Behavior

- **Automatic Sync:** Regular updates from your Cloudflare zones  
- **Manual Sync:** Click **Refresh** anytime  
- **Real-time Mapping:** Newly added DNS records appear in ASM within the next sync cycle
