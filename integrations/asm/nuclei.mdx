## Nuclei Integration with Snapsec ASM

The **Nuclei integration** allows Snapsec ASM to run template-based reconnaissance and exposure detection across your external attack surface.  
Once connected, ASM can trigger Nuclei scans, ingest the findings, and update asset exposure status automatically.

---

## 1. What This Integration Does

With Nuclei connected to ASM, you can:

- Discover exposed services, misconfigurations, and weaknesses.
- Scan domains, subdomains, IPs, and URLs monitored by Attack Surface Management.
- Automatically ingest findings into ASM’s **Exposures** section.
- Enrich assets with detected technologies, fingerprints, and metadata.

ASM uses Nuclei templates to continuously test your perimeter for security gaps.

## 2. How to Enable Nuclei Integration

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Find **Nuclei** in the list of available integrations.  
3. Click **Install** or **Configure**.  
4. Choose how Nuclei will be executed:
   - Snapsec-hosted scanning engine  
   - Your custom Nuclei runner (self-hosted)  
5. Save the configuration.

Once installed, the Nuclei adapter appears in **Active Adapters**.

## 3. How Nuclei Works Inside ASM

After setup, ASM will:

- Auto-run Nuclei scans during scheduled discovery cycles.
- Trigger Nuclei when new assets (subdomains, hosts, IPs) are found.
- Parse JSON results and convert them into **Exposures**.
- Display findings in:
  - Exposure Feed  
  - Asset Exposure Panel  
  - Technology & Service Detection  

Each asset is updated with:

- Severity  
- Template ID  
- Description  
- Evidence  
- First/Last Seen timestamps

## 4. Supported Nuclei Use Cases

- Subdomain & host vulnerability detection  
- Exposure fingerprinting  
- Misconfiguration scanning  
- Technology & service identification  
- API endpoint probing  
- Asset-level risk scoring enrichment  

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

**No results appearing?**

- Ensure your Nuclei runner has internet access.  
- Validate that assets resolve (DNS, IP reachable).  

**Adapter stuck in “Waiting”?**

- Restart your Nuclei engine or re-authorize your configuration.  

**Templates not running?**

- Check if your Nuclei install includes the official template repository.
