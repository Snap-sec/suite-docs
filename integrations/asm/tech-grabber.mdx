## Tech Grabber integration with Snapsec ASM

The **Tech Grabber** integration enhances your Attack Surface Management by automatically identifying technologies, frameworks, services, and stack fingerprints associated with every discovered asset.

Once enabled, it enriches domains, subdomains, IPs, and URLs with detailed technology metadata, helping you understand your tech landscape and uncover outdated or vulnerable components.

## 1. What Tech Grabber Does

With this integration enabled, Snapsec ASM can automatically:

- Detect frontend & backend technologies  
- Identify web frameworks, CMS, servers, and libraries  
- Capture stack fingerprints (Apache, Nginx, Express.js, React, Laravel, etc.)  
- Highlight outdated or potentially vulnerable versions  
- Enrich assets for exposure analysis and risk classification  

The detected technology data is sent directly into AIM (Asset Inventory Management) and used across ASM for tagging, rules, exposures, and prioritization.

## 2. Prerequisites

There are **no special prerequisites** for enabling Tech Grabber.

Snapsec ASM will automatically process technologies for all assets as soon as the adapter is installed.

You only need:

- Access to **Snapsec Suite**
- Permissions to install integrations under **ASM → Integrations**

---

## 3. Installing Tech Grabber in Snapsec ASM

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**
2. Find **Tech Grabber**
3. Click **Install**
4. The adapter activates instantly — no API keys or external configuration required

Once activated, the next discovery cycle or any new asset will automatically be enriched with technology fingerprints.

## 4. How Technology Detection Works

After installation:

- ASM runs passive & active fingerprinting checks  
- Technologies detected from headers, responses, fingerprints, and patterns  
- Output is pushed to AIM under **Technology Index**  
- ASM uses detected tech to:
  - Flag outdated versions  
  - Determine exposure levels  
  - Improve attack surface understanding  

You can view detected technologies under:

- **ASM → Asset Catalog**
- **AIM → Technology Index**
- **Subdomain / IP / URL asset full view**

## 5. Why This Integration Matters

The Tech Grabber integration helps your security program:

- Identify risky technologies at a glance  
- Detect outdated or unsupported software  
- Strengthen threat modeling by understanding stack composition  
- Improve prioritization by aligning tech with known vulnerabilities  

It provides deep visibility into what powers your attack surface — essential for both offensive and defensive security workflows.
