## Snapsec VM Integration with Attack Surface Management (ASM)

The **Snapsec VM integration** allows you to seamlessly forward exposures, misconfigurations, service detections, and discovered vulnerabilities from **Snapsec ASM** into the **Vulnerability Management (VM)** module for deeper triage, remediation workflows, SLA tracking, ownership assignment, and reporting.

This integration ensures that anything discovered through external attack surface scans becomes part of your centralized vulnerability lifecycle.

---

## 1. What This Integration Does

Once enabled, the Snapsec VM adapter:

- Sends **ASM exposures** (open ports, banners, technologies, risky services).
- Forwards **ASM-detected vulnerabilities**, including:
  - Weak SSL configurations  
  - Open directory listings  
  - Misconfigured cloud services  
  - Exposed admin panels  
  - Fingerprint-based vulnerabilities  
- Maps ASM findings into VM’s structured vulnerability model.
- Automatically creates or updates vulnerabilities inside the selected VM Assessment.
- Syncs asset information (domains, IPs, APIs, subdomains) into VM.

This enables unified remediation inside the VM module.

## 2. How to Enable the Integration

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Find **Snapsec VM** in the integration list.  
3. Click **Install**.  
4. Enter the required details:
   - **Assessment ID** (where findings should be pushed)
   - **API Key** (for authentication)
5. Save the configuration.

Once connected, ASM will automatically route all future exposures and vulnerabilities into the assigned VM Assessment.

## 3. Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Assessment ID** | The VM assessment where ASM findings will be stored. |
| **API Key** | Auth token for secure ingestion into Snapsec VM. |

---

## 4. How Data Flows Into VM

When ASM discovers something new:

1. Exposure or vulnerability is generated in ASM.  
2. Integration webhook transforms the finding into VM’s schema.  
3. VM creates or updates:
   - Vulnerability entry  
   - Asset association  
   - Severity & risk metadata  
4. The vulnerability appears in **VM → Vulnerabilities** within seconds.

---

## 5. Supported Finding Types Sent to VM

Snapsec ASM sends the following categories:

- **Surface Exposures**
  - Open ports  
  - TLS handshake data  
  - Service banners  
  - Technologies fingerprinted  

- **Vulnerability-like Issues**
  - Weak/expired SSL certs  
  - Publicly accessible admin dashboards  
  - Open storage buckets  
  - Default pages or unsafe server headers  
  - Known misconfigurations detected via scanners  

- **API-related exposures** (if API discovery is enabled)

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

**Findings not appearing in VM?**

- Check the **Assessment ID** is valid.  
- Confirm your **API key** is active.  
- Verify ASM scan results exist for the assets you're monitoring.  

**Getting authentication errors?**

- Regenerate the API key and update the integration config.
