## Swagger Integration with Snapsec ASM

Use the **Swagger integration** to automatically ingest API endpoints into Snapsec ASM by uploading or onboarding your OpenAPI/Swagger specification files.  
This integration helps ensure complete API visibility across your attack surface.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before importing your API specifications, ensure you have:

- A **Swagger/OpenAPI file** (`.json` or `.yaml`).
- Valid API definitions with paths, methods, and metadata.
- Access to Snapsec ASM with permission to install integrations.

---

## 2. Enable Swagger Integration in Snapsec ASM

1. Navigate to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate **Swagger** in the integrations list.  
3. Click **Install** to enable the adapter.

Once enabled, you can immediately start importing API specifications.

---

## 3. Import Swagger / OpenAPI Specification

After enabling the integration:

1. Open **ASM → API Catalog**.  
2. Click **Import Swagger**.  
3. Upload your specification file (`.yaml` or `.json`).  
4. Snapsec will automatically parse:
   - API endpoints  
   - HTTP methods  
   - Parameters  
   - Descriptions  
   - Security schemas  

Extracted APIs will appear instantly in the API Catalog.

---

## 4. Supported File Formats

Snapsec supports:

- **OpenAPI v2 (Swagger 2.0)**
- **OpenAPI v3.x**
- JSON and YAML formats

Malformed specifications will show validation errors so you can fix them before importing.

---

## 5. What Gets Imported

From your Swagger definition, Snapsec ASM extracts:

- Endpoint paths  
- Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)  
- Tags and grouping  
- Query/body parameters  
- Authentication requirements  
- Descriptions and summaries  

This ensures your API attack surface is always mapped and monitored.

---

## 6. Updating Swagger Specifications

If your APIs evolve:

- Upload a **new version** of your Swagger file.  
- Snapsec will automatically:
  - Add new endpoints
  - Update changed endpoints
  - Mark removed endpoints as deprecated  

No manual cleanup required.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Validation Failed:** Ensure your Swagger/OpenAPI structure follows official schema.  
- **Missing Endpoints:** Check if they are inside the `paths` object.  
- **Upload Error:** Confirm the file format is `.json` or `.yaml`.

---

Snapsec ASM uses the Swagger integration to maintain accurate, continuously updated API inventories across your environment.
