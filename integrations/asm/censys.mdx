## Censys Integration with Snapsec ASM

The **Censys integration** allows Snapsec ASM to automatically fetch internet-wide discovery data, including exposed IPs, open ports, services, certificates, and domain assets associated with your organization.

This integration enhances your external attack surface visibility using one of the most trusted OSINT platforms.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling Censys in Snapsec ASM, ensure you have:

- A **Censys account**  
- **API ID**  
- **API Secret**  
- Optional: An ASM project already created in Snapsec

You can obtain your Censys API keys here:  
`https://search.censys.io/account/api`

---

## 2. Configure Censys in Snapsec ASM

1. Navigate to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate **Censys** from the list of available integrations.  
3. Click **Install** or **Configure**.  
4. A dialog will appear requesting:
   - **API ID**
   - **API Secret**

Enter your credentials and click **Install Now**.

If the credentials are valid, Snapsec will show the integration as **Connected**.

## 3. What Censys Fetches Into Snapsec ASM

Once connected, the Censys adapter automatically enriches and discovers:

### **Asset Discovery**
- IP addresses associated with your organization
- Domains and subdomains
- Hostnames found from certificates, banners, or DNS records

### **Exposure Intelligence**
- Open ports and running services  
- Service banners and fingerprints  
- TLS/SSL certificate metadata  
- Detected technologies  
- ASN and geolocation details  

### **Risk Signals**
- Exposed services with known vulnerabilities  
- Misconfigurations (e.g., open databases, debug ports)  
- Weak certificates or expired SSL  
- Unmanaged or unknown assets (“shadow assets”)  

Snapsec normalizes this data and adds it to your **Asset Inventory**, **Exposure Catalog**, and **Graph View**.

---

## 4. Sync Frequency

Censys data is periodically refreshed based on your workspace settings.  
You can also trigger a manual refresh by clicking:

**Integrations → Censys → Refresh**

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

**Invalid Credentials**  
- Ensure your API ID and Secret match exactly from your Censys account.

**No Assets Detected**  
- Confirm your organization domains/IP ranges are configured in ASM.  
- Censys may take time to index newly observed hosts.

**Rate Limits**  
- Free Censys accounts have strict rate and quota limits.  
- Upgrade your Censys tier if needed.
