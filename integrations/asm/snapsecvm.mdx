## Snapsec VM Integration with ASM

The **Snapsec VM integration** allows Attack Surface Management (ASM) to automatically enrich discovered external assets with **vulnerability data**—giving analysts a unified view of exposures across both internal and external surfaces.

This integration enables ASM to:

1. Pull vulnerability metadata from Snapsec VM.  
2. Attach VM findings to ASM assets (domains, IPs, APIs, technologies).  
3. Provide centralized visibility across the entire attack surface.

---

## 1. What This Integration Does

Once connected, ASM will:

- **Sync asset-level vulnerabilities** from Snapsec VM.  
- **Display vulnerability counts** directly inside ASM asset pages.  
- Automatically attach:
  - Severity breakdown  
  - Last detected timestamp  
  - Scanner source  
- Provide cross-module linking:
  - From ASM asset → VM vulnerability details  
  - From VM asset → ASM external context  

This results in a single, correlated risk landscape.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before configuring the integration:

- You must have an active **Snapsec VM workspace**.  
- You need a **VM API Key** with permission to read assessment data.  
- ASM must be enabled in your workspace.  

Optional:
- Assessments configured in Snapsec VM for more granular data sync.

---

## 3. Configure Snapsec VM in ASM

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Select **Snapsec VM** from the integrations list.  
3. Click **Install** or **Configure**.  
4. Provide the following details:
   - **API Key**  
   - (Optional) **Assessment IDs** if you want targeted syncing  
5. Click **Save**.

ASM will immediately validate the credentials and begin pulling vulnerability metadata.

## 4. How ASM Uses Data from Snapsec VM

Once the integration is active, ASM will automatically enrich:

### **Domains**
- Vulnerability count  
- Severity grouping  
- Linked affected URLs or API routes  

### **IP Addresses**
- Vulnerable ports  
- Associated services  
- Merged risk score  

### **APIs**
- Endpoint-level vulnerability mapping  
- Historical detection timeline  

### **Technologies**
- Known CVEs associated with detected frameworks  

### **Asset Groups**
- Group-level vulnerability distribution  

All data is displayed natively inside ASM dashboards, tables, and full-view screens.

---

## 5. Sync Frequency

ASM syncs with Snapsec VM on:

- **Initial installation** (full sync)  
- **Every daily scheduled update**  
- **Manual refresh** via the **Refresh Data** button  

During sync, ASM fetches:
- Asset identifiers  
- Vulnerability severity & metadata  
- Scanner sources  
- Timestamps (first/last seen)

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### **Invalid API Key**
- Verify the key was copied correctly.
- Ensure the VM API key has read permissions.

### **No vulnerabilities appearing**
- Ensure the assets exist in VM under matching domains, URLs, or IPs.
- If assessments are configured, verify the correct ones are selected.

### **Sync delays**
- Large VM datasets can take several minutes during the first sync.  
- Retry manual refresh if needed.

If issues persist, contact Snapsec Support with:
- Workspace ID  
- Integration timestamp  
- Error message shown (if any)
