## IPinfo integration with Snapsec ASM

Use the **IPinfo adapter** to automatically enrich discovered external assets with:

- ASN & ISP information  
- Geolocation (country, region, city)  
- IP reputation & hosting type  
- Organization metadata  

This helps ASM build a complete picture of your external attack surface by adding context that cannot be derived from scanning alone.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling the integration, ensure you have:

- An **IPinfo API token**  
- Access to Snapsec ASM  
- Outbound internet access to `ipinfo.io`

---

## 2. Enable IPinfo integration

1. Navigate to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate the **IPinfo** tile under Active Adapters.  
3. Click **Install** (or **Configure** if previously installed).  
4. Enter your **API Token**.  
5. Click **Save** to activate the adapter.

Once connected, the adapter will begin enriching IP assets automatically.

## 3. What IPinfo adds to ASM

Whenever ASM discovers an IP—through scanning, DNS enumeration, or external datasets—the IPinfo adapter adds:

### 🔹 Network & Routing Intelligence  
- ASN (Autonomous System Number)  
- ASN Name  
- ISP / Hosting Provider  

### 🔹 Geolocation Metadata  
- Country  
- Region  
- City  
- Lat/Long (approximate)

### 🔹 Exposure Clues  
- Hosting type (VPN, proxy, hosting provider, residential ranges)  
- Organization ownership where available  

### 🔹 Classification Enhancements  
- Used for environment, exposure, and risk tagging inside ASM & AIM  

---

## 4. How enrichment works

Once enabled:

- New IPs discovered by ASM are **instantly enriched** using live IPinfo lookups.  
- Existing IPs in the inventory are scheduled for **progressive enrichment**.  
- Data is unified across ASM and AIM for improved prioritization.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

**Invalid Token**  
- Ensure the provided API token is active and copied correctly.  

**Rate Limit Reached**  
- Upgrade IPinfo plan or reduce scan frequency.  

**No enrichment data visible**  
- Check if the asset is an IP address (not domain/subdomain).  
- Verify integration status under ASM → Integrations.
