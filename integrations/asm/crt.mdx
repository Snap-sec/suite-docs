## CRT Integration with Snapsec ASM

The **CRT adapter** enables Snapsec ASM to discover subdomains by querying public certificate transparency logs from **crt**.

This provides fast and reliable external asset discovery for any domain with issued TLS certificates.

---

## 1. What CRT Integration Does

ASM uses CRT to automatically:

- Discover newly issued subdomains  
- Identify wildcard certificate expansions  
- Track certificate-based exposure  
- Reveal forgotten or legacy domains  
- Add all discovered assets into the ASM inventory  

This is one of the primary sources of external surface expansion detection.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

No API key is required.

CRT integration works using public CT log queries.

---

## 3. How to Install

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**  
2. Select **CRT**  
3. Click **Install**

ASM immediately begins querying certificate transparency logs.

---

## 4. What Data Gets Imported

- Subdomains  
- Certificate CN / SAN entries  
- Certificate issuance metadata  
- Historical and newly issued CT records  

Assets are automatically enriched and added to the ASM **Asset Catalog**.

---

## 5. Sync Behavior

- **Frequent automatic refreshes** pull new CT log entries  
- Each newly discovered certificate results in new asset detection  
- You may run **Manual Refresh** anytime
