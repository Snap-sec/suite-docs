## Snapsec AIM integration with Snapsec ASM

The **Snapsec AIM → ASM integration** allows ASM to automatically ingest internal assets, enrich discovered external assets, and correlate ownership, tags, and classifications directly from AIM.

With this integration, your external attack surface gains internal context — enabling stronger prioritization, faster triage, and unified asset visibility across the organization.

---

## 1. What this integration does

Once enabled, ASM will automatically:

- Import **internal assets** (domains, IPs, APIs, applications, certificates, technologies, etc.) from AIM.  
- Enrich ASM-discovered assets with:
  - Ownership  
  - Environment tags  
  - Risk metadata  
  - Asset groups  
  - Exposure classification  
- Prevent duplicates by correlating assets across both systems.
- Improve prioritization during exposure analysis by providing internal inventory context.

This helps security teams quickly understand **which internet-facing assets belong to whom**, and whether they tie back to known infrastructure.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

To enable the integration, you need:

- A Snapsec account with access to both **AIM** and **ASM** modules.
- Permissions to install/configure integrations.
- An active AIM workspace containing asset data.

No API keys are required — Snapsec handles authentication internally.

---

## 3. Enable the AIM integration in ASM

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**.  
2. Locate **Snapsec AIM** in the integrations list.  
3. Click **Install** or **Configure**.  
4. Review any sync options (depending on workspace settings):
   - Sync domains  
   - Sync IP addresses  
   - Sync certificates  
   - Sync repositories  
   - Sync applications & APIs  
   - Sync tags & ownership  
5. Click **Save**.

Your ASM workspace will immediately begin synchronizing with AIM.

## 4. How ASM uses AIM data

After integration:

### 🔗 **Asset Correlation**
ASM automatically checks whether discovered assets match internal inventory records.

### 🏷️ **Metadata Enrichment**
ASM pulls:
- Owners  
- Tags  
- Environment  
- Business units  
- Known associations  

into every matching asset.

### ⚡ **Prioritized Exposures**
Exposures on assets marked as:
- *critical*
- *production*
- *externally exposed*
- *owned by key teams*

are highlighted automatically.

### 🧭 **Unified Discovery**
ASM external discovery + AIM internal sources =  
**full inventory visibility across both external and internal landscapes**.

---

## 5. Sync Frequency

- Sync runs **continuously** using Snapsec’s event-driven architecture.
- AIM changes typically appear in ASM within **seconds**.
- You can trigger manual refresh from:
  - **ASM → Integrations → Snapsec AIM → Refresh**

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### AIM assets not showing in ASM?
- Ensure sync options (Domains / IPs / Certs / APIs etc.) are enabled.
- Check if AIM assets are marked active.
- Look for duplicate suppression when ASM already discovered an asset externally.

### Metadata not updating?
- Confirm the asset exists in AIM with correct tags/owner.
- Run **manual refresh**.

### Integration not connecting?
- Ensure your workspace role has integration permissions.
