## HackerTarget integration with Snapsec ASM

The **HackerTarget integration** enhances Snapsec ASM by performing lightweight OSINT-based reconnaissance on your domains.  
Once configured, ASM can automatically fetch subdomains, open ports, HTTP services, and exposure indicators discovered by HackerTarget’s public scanning APIs.

This integration helps teams expand their visibility into unknown or shadow assets without running intrusive scans.

---

## 1. What this integration does

Once installed, Snapsec ASM can use HackerTarget to:

- Enumerate **subdomains**  
- Identify **open ports** exposed on the internet  
- Detect **running HTTP services**  
- Highlight **potential exposures** found via OSINT  
- Automatically associate discovered assets with your ASM inventory  

All results are ingested directly into the **ASM Asset Catalog**.

---

## 2. Prerequisites

Before installing the integration, ensure you have:

- A domain added in Snapsec ASM  
- Internet access from Snapsec to HackerTarget APIs  
- (Optional) HackerTarget API key for extended rate limits  

The integration works with or without an API key, but API usage limits may apply.

---

## 3. How to Install

1. Navigate to **ASM → Integrations**  
2. Locate **HackerTarget**  
3. Click **Install**  
4. (Optional) Enter your **HackerTarget API key**  
5. Save the configuration  

Once installed, HackerTarget becomes an active data source for ASM discovery.

---

## 4. How data is fetched

Snapsec ASM uses multiple HackerTarget API endpoints to enrich discovery:

- `/hostsearch` — discover subdomains  
- `/nmap` — detect open ports  
- `/httpheaders` — identify running HTTP services  

Fetched data is automatically:

- Normalized  
- Classified  
- Added to your ASM asset inventory  
- Tagged with the **HackerTarget adapter**  

---

## 5. Monitoring Scan History

After installation, results appear in:

- **ASM → Scans**  
- **ASM → Asset Catalog → Subdomains / IPs / Ports**  
- **Discovery Logs**, which show timestamps and fetched results  

Each batch of discovered assets is marked with:

> *“Discovered via HackerTarget adapter”*

---

## 6. Removing or Updating the Integration

To modify or remove:

1. Go to **ASM → Integrations**  
2. Open **HackerTarget**  
3. Update the API key or click **Uninstall**  

Removing the integration **does not delete existing assets**, only stops new fetches.
