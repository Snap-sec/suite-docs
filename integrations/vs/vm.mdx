## Snapsec VM Integration with Vulnerability Scanner (VS)

The Snapsec VM integration allows the **Vulnerability Scanner** to automatically push discovered vulnerabilities into **Snapsec VM**.  
This enables unified vulnerability management, centralized triage, and reporting across your entire attack surface.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling the integration, ensure you have:

- Access to **Snapsec VM**
- An **Assessment** created inside Snapsec VM  
- The **Assessment ID**  
- The **API Key** for your VM workspace  

You can find the API key in VM under:

**Settings → API Keys**

---

## 2. Open the Snapsec VM Integration in Vulnerability Scanner

1. Go to **Vulnerability Scanner → Integrations**  
2. Locate the **Snapsec VM** integration tile  
3. Click **Install** (or **Configure** if already connected)

You will see fields similar to:

- **Asset Inventory API Key**
- **Assessment for storing vulnerabilities**
- **Auto-sync Severities**
- **Custom Headers (optional)**

(This matches the UI screenshots you provided.)

---

## 3. Enter Snapsec VM Configuration

In the integration dialog:

### **Asset Inventory API Key**  
Paste the API key from Snapsec VM.

### **Assessment for Storing Vulnerabilities**  
Choose the VM Assessment where you want vulnerabilities from VS to be stored.

### **Auto-sync Severities**  
Select which severities should automatically sync:

- Critical  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  
- Info  

VS will only forward vulnerabilities of the selected severities.

### **Custom Headers (Optional)**  
You may add headers for environments that require:

- Gateway authorization  
- Tenant routing  
- Custom authentication tokens  

Example:

| Header | Value |
|--------|--------|
| `x-org` | `acme` |
| `x-api-version` | `2` |

You can also delete or add new headers anytime.

Click **Update** to save the integration.

## 4. How Syncing Works

Once configured:

- Every scan in Vulnerability Scanner will generate a list of vulnerabilities.
- VS will automatically send selected-severity vulnerabilities to the configured VM Assessment.
- Each synced vulnerability will show a **“Send to VM”** icon or status indicator.
- In Snapsec VM, they appear under **Vulnerabilities**, linked back to the scanned asset.

The integration ensures:

- No duplicated entries  
- Continuous enrichment from ASM / AIM if assets overlap  
- Centralized triage and remediation  

---

## 5. Manual Sync (Optional)

From the Vulnerabilities list in VS:

1. Open **Vulnerability Scanner → Vulnerabilities**  
2. Select any vulnerability  
3. Click **Send to VM**

This option is useful for:

- Testing the integration  
- Sending low-severity vulnerabilities that are not auto-synced  

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### **Invalid API Key**
- Ensure the key matches EXACTLY as generated in Snapsec VM  
- Regenerate the key if needed  

### **Assessment not showing**
- Ensure the API key has permissions  
- Refresh the integration page  
- Try reloading VS  

### **Vulnerabilities not syncing**
- Check auto-sync severities  
- Ensure the assessment is correctly selected  
- Verify VM is reachable (network access allowed)
