## Snapsec AIM Integration with Vulnerability Scanner (VS)

The **Snapsec AIM integration** allows the Vulnerability Scanner to automatically:

- Pull assets from Snapsec AIM into VS.  
- Map and store vulnerability findings back into the correct Asset Inventory.  
- Keep the asset inventory and live scan results fully synchronized.

This ensures VS always scans the latest assets, and AIM always stays updated with fresh vulnerability data.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before configuring Snapsec AIM in VS, ensure you have:

- An active **Snapsec AIM workspace**  
- **AIM API Key** (from the AIM settings page)  
- Optional: A designated **Assessment in VM** where VS-generated vulnerabilities will be stored  
- VS user permissions to configure integrations

You can obtain the AIM API Key from:  
**AIM → Settings → API Key**

---

## 2. Configure Snapsec AIM inside Vulnerability Scanner

1. Go to **Vulnerability Scanner → Integrations**.  
2. Open the **Snapsec AIM** integration tile.  
3. You will see the section:

   - **Asset Inventory Integration**  
   - **Asset Inventory API Key**

4. Paste your AIM **API Key** into the field.

5. Click **Refresh** to validate the key.  
6. Click **Save** once connected.

When the connection is successful, VS will begin syncing assets from AIM, visible under:  
**VS → Catalogue → Assets**

---

## 3. Vulnerability Synchronization Configuration

VS lets you decide how vulnerability data should sync back into Snapsec AIM.

You will see a configuration panel inside the AIM integration:

### **Assessment for storing vulnerabilities**

Choose an existing VM Assessment where VS should send discovered vulnerabilities.

Example:  
- `External Attack Surface Scan`  
- `API Security Scan`  
- `Infra Assessment`

This field is required before vulnerabilities can sync.

---

### **Auto-sync Severities**

Select which severities should automatically sync to AIM:

- Critical  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  
- Info  

VS will only push vulnerabilities matching these severities.

---

### **Custom Headers (Optional)**

You can add custom headers for environments requiring routing, tenancy, or authentication.

Example:

Header | Value  
------ | ------  
`x-tenant` | `customer-01`  
`source` | `vs-scanner`

Add as many headers as needed using the **Add Header** button.

---

## 4. How the Integration Works

Once configured:

### **AIM → VS**
- Assets from AIM automatically appear in VS under **Catalogue → Assets**.
- These assets can be grouped and scanned.
- VS will periodically refresh these assets.

### **VS → AIM**
- Discovered vulnerabilities are pushed to the chosen VM Assessment.
- AIM’s asset pages will show associated vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerability state changes propagate back depending on workspace rules.

This creates a **bidirectional sync** between Asset Management and Vulnerability Management through VS.

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

### **Invalid API Key**
- Ensure the AIM key hasn’t expired.
- Regenerate a key if needed.

### **Assets not appearing**
- Verify the AIM workspace actually contains assets.
- Check if asset types are supported by VS.

### **Vulnerabilities not syncing**
- Ensure an Assessment is selected.
- Verify auto-sync severities include the vulnerability severity.
- Check custom header rules aren’t blocking the request.

### **Refresh Issues**
- Use the **Refresh** button next to the API key field.
- If rate-limited, wait a few minutes and try again.
