## Swagger Integration with Snapsec WAS

The **Swagger integration** allows Snapsec WAS to automatically ingest API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger) to generate API endpoints, detect routes, understand request/response schemas, and improve API security testing coverage.

Snapsec uses the imported Swagger/OpenAPI definition to map your API landscape and identify potential security risks earlier in the development lifecycle.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling Swagger in Snapsec WAS, ensure you have:

- A valid **Swagger/OpenAPI specification** (JSON or YAML)
- Optional:
  - A **public URL** hosting the Swagger spec  
  - An existing project in WAS (recommended)

Supported versions:

- OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger)
- OpenAPI 3.x

---

## 2. Configure Swagger in Snapsec WAS

1. Navigate to **WAS → Integrations**.  
2. Locate **Swagger** from the available adapters.  
3. Click **Install** or **Configure**.  
4. Choose your preferred import method:
   - **Upload File (.json / .yaml)**
   - **Provide URL** to the hosted Swagger spec

5. Click **Import Now**.

If the spec is valid, Snapsec will parse it and automatically generate API endpoints under your selected project.

## 3. What Swagger Imports Into Snapsec WAS

Once uploaded, Snapsec analyzes the API specification and extracts:

### **API Endpoint Discovery**
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- Path parameters, query parameters, request bodies  
- Auth requirements (Basic, Bearer, API key)

### **Schema & Payload Understanding**
- JSON schema definitions  
- Data types and validation rules  
- Nested objects and arrays

### **Security Insights**
- Missing authentication  
- Unsafe default values  
- Sensitive parameters  
- Potential injection points  
- Unvalidated inputs  

Snapsec uses this data to generate accurate API tests and enhance vulnerability detection.

## 4. Supported Import Methods

| Method | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Direct Upload** | Upload `.json` or `.yaml` Swagger/OpenAPI files. |
| **Swagger URL** | Provide a URL pointing to a hosted API spec. |
| **Automated via CI/CD** *(coming soon)* | Auto-push specs during deployment. |

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

**Invalid Specification**  
- Ensure the file follows OpenAPI 2.0 / 3.x formatting.  
- Validate using tools like Swagger Editor or Redocly.

**Endpoints not appearing**  
- Confirm paths are defined under `paths:` section.  
- Ensure no circular references in the schema.

**URL import fails**  
- Check if the endpoint is public or requires authentication.  
- Verify CORS and content-type headers.
