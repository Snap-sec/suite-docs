## Postman Integration with Snapsec WAS

The **Postman integration** allows Snapsec WAS to fetch API endpoints directly from your Postman collections.  
This is ideal when your team manages APIs through Postman but lacks a formal Swagger/OpenAPI spec.

Snapsec will sync your collections, extract endpoints, and prepare them for automated API security testing.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before enabling Postman in Snapsec WAS, ensure you have:

- A **Postman account**
- A **Postman API Key**
- An exported or hosted Postman Collection
- Optional: Environments containing variables used in requests

Generate your API key here:  
`https://web.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys`

---

## 2. Configure Postman in Snapsec WAS

1. Navigate to **WAS → Integrations**.  
2. Find **Postman** in the integrations list.  
3. Click **Install**.  
4. Enter your:
   - **Postman API Key**
   - (Optional) Collection ID  
   - (Optional) Environment ID  

Click **Install Now** to connect Postman with Snapsec WAS.

If the credentials are valid, Snapsec will mark the integration as **Connected**.

## 3. What Postman Fetches Into Snapsec WAS

Once connected, Snapsec retrieves:

### **API Endpoint Discovery**
- Request URLs  
- HTTP methods  
- Headers & parameters  
- Authentication tokens (masked for security)  
- Body structure and payload formats  
- Collection-level and folder-level organization  

### **Dynamic Context Mapping**
Snapsec uses Postman metadata to understand:

- Expected request flows  
- Variables & environment dependencies  
- Common authentication patterns  
- Multi-step or chained requests  

### **Security Insights from Postman Collections**
Snapsec identifies:

- Sensitive endpoints  
- Unauthenticated routes  
- Endpoints accepting user input  
- Unsafe request patterns  
- Potential injection surfaces  

All imported endpoints appear in the **WAS API Catalogue**.

---

## 4. Syncing Postman Collections

You can re-sync anytime:

**Integrations → Postman → Refresh**

Snapsec automatically updates:
- New endpoints  
- Deleted or modified endpoints  
- Variables and environments  

---

## 5. Troubleshooting

**401 Unauthorized**  
- API key is invalid, expired, or missing required permissions.

**Collection Not Found**  
- Ensure the Collection ID is correct and not part of a private workspace unless allowed.

**Variables Not Resolved**  
- Confirm the correct Environment ID is selected.
