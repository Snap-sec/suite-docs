## Nuclei CI/CD integration with Snapsec VM

This guide shows you, step by step, how to:

1. Run `nuclei` in your **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** pipeline.
2. Generate a JSON report.
3. Send that JSON report directly to **Snapsec VM** using a webhook.

You do **not** need to be a CI/CD expert to follow this guide.

### 1. Prerequisites

- A target or list of targets for Nuclei (for example, URLs in a `targets.txt` file).  
- Nuclei installed in your CI environment (we’ll show how below).  
- Snapsec:
  - An **Assessment** in Snapsec VM where Nuclei vulnerabilities will be stored.
  - **Assessment ID** (`<assessment-id>`)
  - **API key** (`<your-api-key>`)
- CI environment with `curl` available.

### 2. Create an assessment in Snapsec VM

Before you send any results, create a dedicated assessment in Snapsec VM that will hold the Nuclei findings:

1. Log in to the Snapsec UI.  
2. Go to the **VM / Assessments** section.  
3. Click **New Assessment** (or the equivalent button) and give it a clear name, for example:  
   - `Nuclei - MyService`  
4. Save the assessment and copy its **Assessment ID** value.  

You will use this **Assessment ID** in the webhook URL in the next steps.

### 3. Generate Nuclei JSON report (locally or in CI)

First, make sure you can run Nuclei and produce JSON output.

For example, with a `targets.txt` file containing one URL per line:

```bash
nuclei -l targets.txt -severity low,medium,high,critical -json -o nuclei.json
```

This command:

- Reads targets from `targets.txt`.  
- Runs Nuclei with selected severities.  
- Writes a machine-readable report to `nuclei.json`.  

You can try this locally first to confirm it works before adding it to your CI.

## 4. Push Nuclei JSON directly to Snapsec VM via webhook

Snapsec already knows how to parse Nuclei JSON output, so you can send the file directly to an import endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://suite.snapsec.co/csm/api/import/<assessment-id>/nuclei-scanning" \
     -H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @nuclei.json \
     -k
```

> **Important:** Replace `<assessment-id>` with your actual Assessment ID and `<your-api-key>` with your API key.  
>  
> **Note on the `-k` flag:** This flag tells `curl` to perform an "insecure" SSL transfer, which bypasses certificate validation. You may need this for local or development environments. Remove it if your endpoint has a valid SSL certificate.

Below are ready-to-use examples for **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI**.

## 5. GitHub Actions example

```yaml
name: Nuclei to Snapsec

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  nuclei-snapsec:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Install Nuclei
        run: |
          curl -sSfL https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/latest/download/nuclei_$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_amd64.tar.gz -o nuclei.tar.gz
          tar -xzf nuclei.tar.gz nuclei
          sudo mv nuclei /usr/local/bin/

      - name: Prepare targets
        run: echo "https://example.com" > targets.txt

      - name: Run Nuclei
        run: nuclei -l targets.txt -severity low,medium,high,critical -json -o nuclei.json

      - name: Push to Snapsec
        env:
          SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID: ${{ secrets.SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID }}
          SNAPSEC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SNAPSEC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://suite.snapsec.co/csm/api/import/${SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID}/nuclei-scanning" \
               -H "x-api-key: ${SNAPSEC_API_KEY}" \
               -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
               -d @nuclei.json \
               -k
```

**How to use this:**

1. Create `.github/workflows/nuclei-to-snapsec.yml` in your repository.
2. Copy the YAML above into that file.
3. In your GitHub repository settings, create secrets:
   - `SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID`
   - `SNAPSEC_API_KEY`
4. Adjust the **Install Nuclei** and **Prepare targets** steps to match how you want to run Nuclei.  
5. Push your changes. GitHub Actions will run the workflow on each push or pull request.

## 6. GitLab CI example

If you use GitLab, add a job like this to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
nuclei_to_snapsec:
  image: golang:1.22
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/v3/cmd/nuclei@latest
    - export PATH="$PATH:/root/go/bin"
  script:
    - echo "https://example.com" > targets.txt
    - nuclei -l targets.txt -severity low,medium,high,critical -json -o nuclei.json
    - >
      curl -X POST
      "https://suite.snapsec.co/csm/api/import/${SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID}/nuclei-scanning"
      -H "x-api-key: ${SNAPSEC_API_KEY}"
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
      -d @nuclei.json
      -k
  variables:
    SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID: "$SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID"
    SNAPSEC_API_KEY: "$SNAPSEC_API_KEY"
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main
```

**How to use this:**

1. Create or edit `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your repository.
2. Add the `nuclei_to_snapsec` job shown above.
3. In your GitLab project, go to **Settings → CI/CD → Variables** and add:
   - `SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID`
   - `SNAPSEC_API_KEY`
4. Adjust the targets and Nuclei command as needed for your environment.  
5. Commit and push your changes. GitLab will run the job on merge requests and on the `main` branch.

With these examples, even if you are new to CI/CD, you can:

1. Run Nuclei automatically in your pipeline.  
2. Upload the `nuclei.json` report directly to Snapsec VM using the provided webhook.
