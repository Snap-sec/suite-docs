## AIM asset inventory integration with Snapsec VM

Use the **AIM** (Asset Inventory Management) integration to sync your asset catalog into Snapsec VM.  
Once connected, all assets from AIM will appear in the VM asset catalog, and vulnerability data will automatically be linked to the right assets.

### 1. What this integration does

- **Fetches assets from AIM** into Snapsec VM.  
- Populates the **full asset catalog** in **`/vm/assets`**.  
- Ensures that **vulnerabilities discovered in Snapsec VM are automatically associated** with the correct assets from AIM (based on identifiers such as hostname, IP, or other internal mappings).  

This gives you a single, unified view of assets and their vulnerabilities inside Snapsec VM.

### 2. Prerequisites

- Access to **Snapsec AIM** with a valid **API key**.  
- Permissions in AIM to read asset information.  
- Permissions in Snapsec VM to manage integrations.

If you do not have an AIM API key yet, contact your Snapsec administrator to generate one.

### 3. Open the AIM integration in Snapsec VM

1. In Snapsec, go to **VM → Integrations**.  
2. Find the **AIM** tile (Asset Inventory Management Software).  
3. Click **Install** (or **Configure** if you are editing an existing connection).  
4. A dialog like **Integrate AIM** will open with the fields:
   - **Description**
   - **API Key**

### 4. Fill in AIM connection details

In the **Integrate AIM** dialog:

- **Description**: Add a short, meaningful description for this connection, for example:  
  - `AIM - Production Assets`  
  - `AIM - Corporate Endpoints`  
- **API Key**: Paste the **API key** you generated in AIM for Snapsec VM to use.

Click **Install Now** to save and validate the connection.

If the details are correct, the integration status will show as **Connected**.

### 5. What happens after integration

Once the AIM integration is active:

- Snapsec VM **pulls assets from AIM** and populates the asset catalog at **`/vm/assets`**.  
- New or updated assets in AIM will appear in Snapsec VM according to your workspace sync configuration.  
- When vulnerabilities are imported into Snapsec VM (for example, from scanners like Nuclei, Trivy, Qualys, etc.), they will be **automatically associated with the correct assets** from AIM whenever a matching identifier is found.

This allows you to:

- See **all assets** in one place.  
- Filter and prioritize vulnerabilities by **asset** (e.g. critical servers, production services).  
- Drive remediation workflows using accurate, up‑to‑date inventory data.

### 6. Troubleshooting

- **Authentication errors**:
  - Double‑check that the API key is correct and has not expired or been revoked.  
  - Ensure the key has permission to read assets in AIM.  
- **No assets appearing in `/vm/assets`**:
  - Confirm the integration status is **Connected**.  
  - Verify there are assets present in AIM and that your account can see them.  
- **Vulnerabilities not linked to assets**:
  - Check that the identifiers used by scanners (hostnames, IPs, IDs) match those stored in AIM.  
  - Contact your Snapsec administrator if custom mapping rules are needed.

If issues persist, share the integration configuration and any error messages with your Snapsec support contact for further assistance.
