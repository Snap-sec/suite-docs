## Jira ticketing integration with Snapsec VM

Use the Jira integration to automatically create and sync tickets from Snapsec VM findings into your existing Jira projects.

### 1. Prerequisites

- An active **Jira Cloud** account.  
- A Jira user with permission to:
  - Browse the target project.
  - Create and edit issues.
- Your:
  - **Email** (Jira account email).
  - **Domain** (e.g. `your-company.atlassian.net`).
  - **API token** for Jira (created from your Atlassian account).

#### Create a Jira API token

1. Log in to Atlassian at `https://id.atlassian.com/`.  
2. Go to **Security → API tokens**.  
3. Click **Create API token**, give it a descriptive label (for example, `Snapsec VM`), and click **Create**.  
4. Copy the generated token and keep it somewhere safe (you will paste it into Snapsec).  

> The API token acts like a password for integrations. Keep it secret and rotate it periodically.

### 2. Open the Jira integration in Snapsec VM

1. In Snapsec, go to **VM → Integrations**.  
2. Find the **Jira** tile and click **Install** (or **Configure** if you are editing an existing connection).  
3. A dialog like **Integrate Jira** will open with the fields:
   - **Email**
   - **Domain**
   - **API Token**

### 3. Fill in Jira connection details

In the **Integrate Jira** dialog:

- **Email**: Enter your Jira account email (the same one used to create the API token).  
- **Domain**: Enter your Jira site domain, for example:  
  - `your-company.atlassian.net`  
  (Do **not** include `https://` or trailing slashes.)  
- **API Token**: Paste the API token you generated in Atlassian.  

Click **Install Now** (or **Save**) to validate the credentials and connect Jira with Snapsec VM.

If the details are correct, the integration status will show as **Connected**.

### 4. How tickets are created from Snapsec VM

Once Jira is connected, you can create tickets directly from Snapsec VM findings:

1. Open a finding in Snapsec VM.  
2. Choose **Create Jira ticket** (or the equivalent action such as **Create Issue**).  
3. Select:
   - The **Jira project** where you want the issue to be created.  
   - The **issue type** (for example, `Bug` or `Task`).  
4. Review and adjust the title and description if needed, then confirm.

Snapsec VM will create a Jira issue containing key details about the vulnerability (severity, description, affected asset, and remediation notes) and store the Jira issue key/link on the finding.

### 5. Keeping Jira tickets and findings in sync

- When a Jira ticket created from Snapsec VM is updated (for example, status changed to **Done**), Snapsec can reflect this in the associated finding, depending on your synchronization settings.  
- When a finding is marked as **Resolved** in Snapsec, you can optionally transition or comment on the linked Jira ticket to keep engineering teams up to date.

> Exact sync behavior (status mappings, comments, etc.) may depend on your workspace configuration. Contact your Snapsec administrator if you need custom mappings.

### 6. Troubleshooting

- **Authentication errors**:
  - Double‑check the email, domain, and API token.
  - Ensure the token has not been revoked in Atlassian.  
- **Cannot see projects or create issues**:
  - Confirm the Jira user associated with the token has permission to browse and create issues in the target project.  
- **Network / SSL issues**:
  - Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS connections to your Jira domain.  

If problems persist, share the error message and request ID (if shown) with your Snapsec support contact for further help.
