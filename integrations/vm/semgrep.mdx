## Semgrep CI/CD integration with Snapsec VM

This guide shows you, step by step, how to:

1. Run `semgrep` in your **GitHub Actions** or **GitLab CI** pipeline.
2. Generate a JSON report.
3. Send that JSON report directly to **Snapsec VM** using a webhook.

You do **not** need to be a CI/CD expert to follow this guide.

### 1. Prerequisites

- A codebase you want to scan with Semgrep.  
- Semgrep installed in your CI environment (we’ll show how below).  
- Snapsec:
  - An **Assessment** in Snapsec VM where Semgrep findings will be stored.
  - **Assessment ID** (`<assessment-id>`)
  - **API key** (`<your-api-key>`)
- CI environment with `curl` available.

### 2. Create an assessment in Snapsec VM

Before you send any results, create a dedicated assessment in Snapsec VM that will hold the Semgrep findings:

1. Log in to the Snapsec UI.  
2. Go to the **VM / Assessments** section.  
3. Click **New Assessment** and give it a clear name, for example:  
   - `Semgrep - MyService`  
4. Save the assessment and copy its **Assessment ID** value.  

You will use this **Assessment ID** in the webhook URL in the next steps.

### 3. Generate Semgrep JSON report (locally or in CI)

To run Semgrep with the recommended rules and output JSON:

```bash
semgrep --config auto --json --output semgrep.json
```

You can try this locally first to confirm it works before adding it to your CI.

## 4. Push Semgrep JSON directly to Snapsec VM via webhook

Snapsec already knows how to parse Semgrep JSON output, so you can send the file directly to an import endpoint.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://suite.snapsec.co/csm/api/import/<assessment-id>/nuclei-scanning" \
     -H "x-api-key: <your-api-key>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @semgrep.json \
     -k
```

> **Important:** Replace `<assessment-id>` with your actual Assessment ID and `<your-api-key>` with your API key.  
>  
> **Note on the `-k` flag:** This flag tells `curl` to perform an "insecure" SSL transfer, which bypasses certificate validation. You may need this for local or development environments. Remove it if your endpoint has a valid SSL certificate.

Below are ready-to-use examples for **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI**.

## 5. GitHub Actions example

```yaml
name: Semgrep to Snapsec

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  semgrep-snapsec:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run Semgrep
        uses: returntocorp/semgrep-action@v1
        with:
          config: auto
          json: true
          output: semgrep.json

      - name: Push to Snapsec
        env:
          SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID: ${{ secrets.SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID }}
          SNAPSEC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SNAPSEC_API_KEY }}
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://suite.snapsec.co/csm/api/import/${SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID}/nuclei-scanning" \
               -H "x-api-key: ${SNAPSEC_API_KEY}" \
               -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
               -d @semgrep.json \
               -k
```

**How to use this:**

1. Create `.github/workflows/semgrep-to-snapsec.yml` in your repository.
2. Copy the YAML above into that file.
3. In your GitHub repository settings, create secrets:
   - `SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID`
   - `SNAPSEC_API_KEY`
4. Adjust the Semgrep configuration (rules, paths, etc.) as needed.  
5. Push your changes. GitHub Actions will run the workflow on each push or pull request.

## 6. GitLab CI example

If you use GitLab, add a job like this to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
semgrep_to_snapsec:
  image: returntocorp/semgrep:latest
  stage: test
  script:
    - semgrep --config auto --json --output semgrep.json
    - >
      curl -X POST
      "https://suite.snapsec.co/csm/api/import/${SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID}/nuclei-scanning"
      -H "x-api-key: ${SNAPSEC_API_KEY}"
      -H "Content-Type: application/json"
      -d @semgrep.json
      -k
  variables:
    SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID: "$SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID"
    SNAPSEC_API_KEY: "$SNAPSEC_API_KEY"
  only:
    - merge_requests
    - main
```

**How to use this:**

1. Create or edit `.gitlab-ci.yml` in the root of your repository.
2. Add the `semgrep_to_snapsec` job shown above.
3. In your GitLab project, go to **Settings → CI/CD → Variables** and add:
   - `SNAPSEC_ASSESSMENT_ID`
   - `SNAPSEC_API_KEY`
4. Commit and push your changes. GitLab will run the job on merge requests and on the `main` branch.

With these examples, even if you are new to CI/CD, you can:

1. Run Semgrep automatically in your pipeline.  
2. Upload the `semgrep.json` report directly to Snapsec VM using the provided webhook.
