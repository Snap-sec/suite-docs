## Google Sheet integration with Snapsec VM

Use the **Google Sheet Import** integration to pull vulnerabilities from a Google Sheet into a Snapsec VM assessment.  
You share a sheet, choose the target assessment, and define how each row should be turned into a readable report using a simple markdown template.

### 1. Prerequisites

- A **Google Sheet** that contains your vulnerability data in tabular form (one row per vulnerability).  
- Access to share the sheet with the Snapsec Google service account (your admin will provide the address if required).  
- In Snapsec VM:
  - An **Assessment** where the imported vulnerabilities will be stored.

### 2. Prepare your Google Sheet

1. Create or open a Google Sheet.  
2. Use the **first row** for column headers, for example:
   - `title`
   - `impact`
   - `severity`
   - `asset`
   - `steps_to_reproduce`  
3. Add one vulnerability per row, filling in each column with the relevant details.

> The column names in the header row will be used as placeholders in your markdown report template.

### 3. Share the Google Sheet

1. In Google Sheets, click **Share**.  
2. Share the sheet with the Snapsec service account email (or follow the instructions from your Snapsec administrator).  
3. Make sure it has at least **Viewer** access so Snapsec can read the data.

Copy the **shareable link** to use in the integration.

### 4. Configure Google Sheet Import in Snapsec VM

1. In Snapsec, go to **VM → Integrations**.  
2. Click the **Google Sheet Import** / **CSV Import** tile.  
3. In the **Google Sheet Import** dialog, fill in:
   - **Adapter Instance Name**: A friendly name for this integration (for example, `Google Sheet - Bug Bounty`).  
   - **Enter Google Sheet URL...**: Paste the shareable link to your Google Sheet.  
   - **Select assessment**: Choose the Snapsec **Assessment** where vulnerabilities from this sheet should be created.

### 5. Write the markdown report template

In the large text area, you define how each row in the sheet should be turned into a vulnerability report using **markdown**.  
You can reference any column from the sheet using `{columnName}` placeholders.

For example:

```md
## {title}

### Summary
{impact}

### Severity
{severity}

### Affected Asset
{asset}

### Steps to Reproduce
{steps_to_reproduce}
```

- `{title}`, `{impact}`, `{severity}`, `{asset}`, and `{steps_to_reproduce}` will be replaced by values from each row.  
- One vulnerability will be created in Snapsec VM **per row** in the sheet, with the report body generated from this template.

When you are done, click **Install**.

### 6. How the import works

After installation:

- Snapsec reads the shared Google Sheet.  
- For each row:
  - It substitutes the `{columnName}` placeholders in your markdown template with the actual cell values.
  - It creates a vulnerability in the **selected assessment** using the rendered markdown as the report body.  
- Any future syncs (if enabled by your admin) will continue to pull new or updated rows into the same assessment.

### 7. Tips and troubleshooting

- **Placeholders not working**:
  - Ensure the placeholder matches the **exact header text** in the sheet (for example, `{title}` for a column named `title`).  
- **No vulnerabilities created**:
  - Confirm the sheet is shared correctly and the URL is valid.  
  - Make sure there is at least one data row under the header.  
- **Wrong assessment**:
  - Edit the integration and select the correct assessment before running the next import.

If you need more control over how columns map to Snapsec fields, contact your Snapsec administrator to discuss advanced adapter configuration.
