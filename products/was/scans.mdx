The **Scans** section provides a centralized overview of all scans performed within the Web Application Scanner (WAS).  
You can track scan progress, rule coverage, vulnerability findings, and manage rescans or deletions — all from a unified interface.

## Overview

The **Scans dashboard** lists every executed or scheduled scan across all WAS projects.  
For each scan, you can quickly determine:

- Scan status (Completed / Running / Failed)
- Total rules executed
- Progress (executed vs. total rules)
- Vulnerability counts (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Execution timestamp
- Available scan actions (rescan, delete)

This enables teams to efficiently monitor scanning behavior and identify gaps or failures.
