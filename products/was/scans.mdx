## Scans Overview

The **Scans Overview** lists all scans executed in the workspace with real-time status and results.

Each scan entry displays:

- **Scan Name** — User-defined identifier  
- **Status** — Completed or in-progress  
- **Rules** — Number of rules applied  
- **Progress** — Requests processed vs total  
- **Vulnerabilities** — Severity-wise breakdown (C / H / M / L)  
- **Actions** — Re-run or delete scan  

This view helps teams quickly assess scan health, coverage, and security findings across projects.
