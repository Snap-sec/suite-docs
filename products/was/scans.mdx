The **Scans** section is where you execute and manage security scans in WAS.  
It provides visibility into scan execution status, applied rules, progress, and discovered vulnerabilities.

## Scans Overview

The **Scans Overview** lists all scans executed in the workspace with real-time status and results.

Each scan entry displays:

- **Scan Name** — User-defined identifier  
- **Status** — Completed or in-progress  
- **Rules** — Number of rules applied  
- **Progress** — Requests processed vs total  
- **Vulnerabilities** — Severity-wise breakdown (C / H / M / L)  
- **Actions** — Re-run or delete scan  

This view helps teams quickly assess scan health, coverage, and security findings across projects.

## Create Scan

</Frame>

Use **Create Scan** to launch a new security scan.

You can configure:

- **Name & Description** — Identify the scan purpose  
- **Rules (optional)** — Select specific detection rules  
- **Environments** — Choose environment variables for execution  
- **Collections** — Target API collections  
- **Projects** — Associate scan with projects  
- **Auth Profile** — Apply authentication logic  
- **Scope** — Limit scan to specific paths or endpoints  

Once created, WAS executes the scan and tracks progress automatically.

## Flush Scans

The **Flush** action permanently removes scan data.

Key points:

- Clears scan execution history  
- Deletes associated results and metrics  
- Requires confirmation before proceeding  

This is useful for cleanup, testing cycles, or resetting scan state during development.
