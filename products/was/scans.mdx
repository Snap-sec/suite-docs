## Overview

This section shows every vulnerability detected across your scanned applications.  
Key metrics displayed at the top include:

- **Total Active** vulnerabilities  
- **Total Resolved** vulnerabilities  

You can filter, search, sort, and take action on individual findings from a centralized view.

## Filters & Search

Use the filter bar to refine vulnerability results:

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Rules Filter" icon="list-check">
  Filter vulnerabilities based on the specific rule or detection signature.
</Card>

<Card title="Scans Filter" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
  Narrow results to vulnerabilities originating from a specific scan run.
</Card>

<Card title="Severity Filter" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  Display vulnerabilities by severity: **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**, or **Informational**.
</Card>

</Columns>

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Status Filter" icon="circle-dot">
  Filter between **Active**, **Suppressed**, or **Resolved** vulnerabilities.
</Card>

<Card title="Suppressed Filter" icon="eye-slash">
  Show only vulnerabilities intentionally suppressed by the user.
</Card>

<Card title="Search Bar" icon="magnifying-glass">
  Search vulnerabilities by keyword, URL, or scan name.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Vulnerability Table

Each row displays complete context for an identified vulnerability:

- **Title**  
- **Endpoint / URL**  
- **Severity**  
- **Status**  
- **Scan Name**  
- **First Detected**  
- **Last Detected**  
- **Actions**

## Severity Labels

<Columns cols={4}>

<Card title="Medium" icon="exclamation">
  Most findings may appear under Medium severity, depending on detection rules.
</Card>

<Card title="Low" icon="circle-info">
  Low-risk issues or informational signals.
</Card>

<Card title="High / Critical" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  Displayed if identified by relevant rules during scans.
</Card>

<Card title="Suppressed" icon="eye-slash">

## Status Indicators

- **Active** — Currently detected and unresolved.  
- **Resolved** — Automatically marked when the scanner no longer detects the issue.  
- **Suppressed** — Manually hidden but still tracked internally.

---

## Actions

The actions column allows you to:

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="View Details" icon="arrow-right">
  Open the vulnerability detail page for complete information.
</Card>

<Card title="Suppress" icon="ban">
  Temporarily hide a vulnerability from active tracking.
</Card>

<Card title="Delete" icon="trash">
  Remove the vulnerability record (administrative use only).
</Card>

</Columns>

## Best Practices

- Regularly filter by **Recent Detections** to identify new risks quickly.  
- Use suppression for **accepted risks**, not unresolved issues.  
- Cross-check recurring issues to track vulnerabilities that reappear after fixes.
