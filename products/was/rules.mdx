The **Rules** section allows you to manage detection logic used by the Web Application Scanner.  
Rules define how requests are transformed, how responses are evaluated, and when vulnerabilities should be reported.
This provides deep customization and fine-tuned control over your security testing.

Below is the exact rule displayed in the interface:

```yaml
rule_name: Detect Unauthorized requests
target: all

transform:
  headers:
    remove:
      - Authorization

match_on:
  status: 200
  response_contains: "unauthorized"

report:
  title: "Unauthorized Without Token"
  description: "Endpoint returns 200 when token is removed"
  severity: "medium"
  cvssScore: 6.3
  cwe: "CWE-284: Improper Access Control"
  impact: "Returning a 200 status code when the Authorization token is removed indicates missing access control."
  mitigation: "Ensure that the server returns the correct HTTP status code when Authorization headers are missing."
  stepsToReproduce: |
    1. Send a request to the target endpoint with a valid Authorization token.
    2. Remove the Authorization header and send the same request again.
    3. Observe that the response still returns a 200 status code with 'unauthorized'.
    4. This indicates the system does not properly enforce authentication.
