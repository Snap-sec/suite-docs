The **Rules** section defines how the Web Application Scanner (WAS) detects vulnerabilities.  
Rules analyze API requests and responses using configurable logic written in YAML, enabling precise and extensible security checks.

## Overview

The **Rules module** allows you to:

- View all available detection rules  
- Enable or disable rules dynamically  
- Track how many vulnerabilities each rule has detected  
- Create or edit rules using a YAML-based editor  
- Sync default rules provided by WAS  

Rules are executed during scans and form the core detection engine of WAS.

## Rule List & Status

<Frame caption="Rule List with Vulnerability Counts">
  <img src="/images/was/products/rules-list.png" />
</Frame>

Each rule entry displays:

- **Rule Name** — Descriptive name of the detection logic  
- **Vuln Count** — Number of vulnerabilities detected by the rule  
- **Status** — Whether the rule is Active or Inactive  
- **Actions** — Edit, delete, or toggle the rule  

This helps teams quickly identify high-impact rules.

## YAML Rule Editor

<Frame caption="YAML Rule Editor">
  <img src="/images/was/products/rules-yaml-editor.png" />
</Frame>

Rules are defined using a structured YAML format that includes:

- **rule name** — Identifier for the rule  
- **target** — Scope of execution (e.g., all requests)  
- **transform** — Request/response transformations  
- **match_on** — Conditions to trigger detection  
- **report** — Vulnerability metadata  

Example capabilities include:

- Removing or modifying headers  
- Matching HTTP status codes  
- Inspecting response bodies  
- Defining severity, CWE, and impact

## Vulnerability Metadata

Within each rule, you can configure:

- **Title & Description**  
- **Severity** (Critical, High, Medium, Low)  
- **CVSS Score**  
- **CWE Mapping**  
- **Impact Description**  
- **Mitigation Guidance**  
- **Steps to Reproduce**  

This ensures detected issues are actionable and well-documented.

</Frame>

The **Sync Default Rules** option allows you to:

- Restore the default WAS rule set  
- Receive updates to built-in detection logic  
- Ensure alignment with latest vulnerability checks  

This is useful after experimentation or custom rule changes.
