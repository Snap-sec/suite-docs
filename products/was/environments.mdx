The **Environments** section allows you to configure deployment variables and vulnerable testing environments used across scans.  
These variables help WAS dynamically interact with production systems and controlled vulnerable targets.

## Overview

The **Environments module** centralizes key-value pairs that define:

- Base URLs for the application under test  
- Additional operational variables required during scanning  
- Vulnerable test environments for security validation workflows  

Environments ensure consistent configuration across scans and eliminate hardcoded values.

## Environment Types

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Production Environment" icon="globe">
  Contains variables used for scanning real applications such as production base URLs.
</Card>

<Card title="Vulnerable Environment" icon="biohazard">
  Defines intentionally vulnerable targets for testing, training, or validation.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Production Environment

<Frame caption="Production Environment — Variable Configuration">
  <img src="/images/was/products/environments-production.png" />
</Frame>

Each entry includes:

- **Key** — Variable name (e.g., `url`)  
- **Type** — Default  
- **Value** — Production endpoint (e.g., `https://apiv2.shiprocket.in`)  

These values are referenced automatically during scans and rule execution.

## Vulnerable Environment

<Frame caption="Vulnerable Environment — Variable Configuration">
  <img src="/images/was/products/environments-vulnerable.png" />
</Frame>

Used for controlled testing scenarios such as:

- Rule validation  
- Security training  
- Detection accuracy testing  

Example variable:
- **Key:** `vuln_base_url`  
- **Value:** `http://54.234.21.239`

</Frame>

You can add custom variables to any environment directly from the Environments page.

To add a variable:

1. Click **Add Variable**  
2. Enter the **Variable Name**  
3. Provide the **Value**  
4. Select the target **Environment** (Production or Vulnerable)  
5. Click **Add Variable** to save  

Once added, variables become instantly available to scans and rules without additional configuration.
