<Banner>
The **Environments** section allows you to configure deployment variables and vulnerable testing environments used across scans.  
These variables help WAS dynamically interact with production systems and controlled vulnerable targets.

## Overview

The **Environments module** centralizes key-value pairs that define:

- Base URLs for the application under test  
- Additional operational variables needed during scanning  
- Vulnerable test environments for security validation workflows  

Environments help ensure consistent configuration across all scans and eliminate hardcoded values.

## Environment Types

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Production Environment" icon="globe">
  Contains variables used for scanning your real application such as production URLs or API keys.
</Card>

<Card title="Vulnerable Environment" icon="biohazard">
  Defines controlled vulnerable systems (e.g., DVWA, custom vulnerable APIs) for training or validation.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Production Environment

<Frame caption="Production Environment — Variable Configuration">
  <img src="/images/was/environments-production.png" />
</Frame>

Each entry in the **Production** section includes:

- **Key** — Name of the variable (e.g., `url`)  
- **Type** — Default or custom category  
- **Value** — Assigned environment value (e.g., `https://apiv2.shiprocket.in`)  

These variables are referenced by WAS during scanning and rule execution.

## Vulnerable Environment

<Frame caption="Vulnerable Environment — Variable Configuration">
  <img src="/images/was/environments-vulnerable.png" />
</Frame>

This section defines variables for intentionally vulnerable applications.

Example use cases:

- Security training and demonstrations  
- Validating exploit detection rules  
- Regression testing after rule updates  

Each record contains:

- **Key** — Variable identifier (e.g., `vuln_base_url`)  
- **Value** — URL of vulnerable host (e.g., `http://54.234.21.239`)
