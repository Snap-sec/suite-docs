The **Scan Profiles** section allows you to define reusable scanning configurations such as custom headers.  
These profiles can be attached to scans to ensure consistent authentication, headers, and request behavior across environments.

## Scan Profiles Overview

</Frame>

The overview page displays:

- A **Profile Details** panel for creating new scan profiles  
- A list of **Existing Scan Profiles** already created  
- Profile metadata such as creation time  

Each scan profile represents a reusable configuration that can be applied while creating scans.

## Create Scan Profile

</Frame>

Use this section to create a new scan profile by defining:

- **Profile Name** — A descriptive name for the scan configuration  
- **Custom Headers** — Key-value HTTP headers added to every request  
  - Header Name  
  - Header Value  
- **Add Header** — Add multiple headers as required  

Click **Create Profile** to save the scan profile.  
Once created, it becomes available for selection while creating scans.

## Edit & Manage Existing Scan Profiles

<Frame caption="Edit Existing Scan Profile">

</Frame>

The **Existing Scan Profiles** section allows you to manage saved profiles:

Each profile card shows:
- **Profile Name**
- **Created At** timestamp

Available actions:
- **Edit** — Update profile name or modify custom headers  
- **Delete** — Remove an unused scan profile  

While editing a profile:
- Existing headers can be updated or removed  
- New headers can be added  
- Changes are saved using **Update Profile**

This ensures scan configurations remain flexible and easy to maintain.
