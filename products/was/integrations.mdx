The **Integrations** section allows you to seamlessly connect external API sources—such as **Postman** or **Swagger**—to automatically import, sync, and update API endpoints in the Web Application Scanner (WAS).  
This ensures your security testing always reflects the most accurate and up-to-date API inventory.

## Overview

The **Integrations page** provides a centralized place to install, configure, and manage adapters that pull APIs into WAS.

You can:

- Install connectors like **Postman** or **Swagger**
- View active adapters and their sync status
- Refresh imported APIs
- Enable continuous synchronization for automatic updates

Once installed, an adapter continuously fetches the latest API changes from the source, keeping WAS in sync with your development workflow.

## Adapter Types

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Postman" icon="file-lines">
  Import APIs directly from **Postman Collections**.  
  Ideal for teams already managing API documentation or testing workflows in Postman.
</Card>

<Card title="Swagger / OpenAPI" icon="diagram-project">
  Upload or connect **Swagger (OAS)** specifications to onboard structured API definitions effortlessly.
</Card>

## Active Adapters

</Frame>

Each installed adapter displays:

- **Adapter Name**  
- **Installation Status**  
- **Last Sync Timestamp**  
- **Actions (Refresh / Remove)**  

This helps teams verify that integrations are functioning correctly and API data is being continuously synchronized.
