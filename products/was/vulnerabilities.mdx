The **Vulnerabilities section** provides a centralized view of all findings discovered across your scanned applications.  
It allows analysts to filter, investigate, and manage vulnerabilities by severity, scan source, suppression status, and more — ensuring complete visibility of application security risks.

## Overview

The Vulnerabilities module aggregates every issue detected across all WAS scans and presents:

- Total active vulnerabilities  
- Total resolved vulnerabilities  
- Severity distribution  
- Recent scan detections  
- Suppressed vs. active vulnerability counts  
- Full vulnerability listing with sorting, filtering, and triage actions  

This serves as the primary panel for identifying and prioritizing security issues across all applications.
