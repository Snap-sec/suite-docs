The **Projects module** in the Web Application Scanner (WAS) provides complete visibility into each scanned application — including request flow, API endpoints, vulnerability findings, and scan configuration.  
It is the core workspace where analysts create, monitor, and optimize application security tests.

## Overview

Each project represents a **single web application** or API environment under assessment.  
A project contains:

- **Metrics** – high-level status and vulnerability counts  
- **API Endpoints** – discovered or imported request inventory  
- **Transformed Requests** – AI-enhanced or mutated requests  
- **Vulnerabilities** – all findings detected during scanning  
- **Configuration** – settings for authentication, crawling, rules, and scope  

Projects enable security teams to organize testing efforts and monitor risk at the application level.

## Project Metrics

<Frame caption="Project Metrics Dashboard">
  <img src="/images/was/projects/metrics.png" />
</Frame>

The **Metrics tab** provides a quick summary of project health:

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Pending Vulnerabilities" icon="triangle-exclamation">
  Total vulnerabilities identified and awaiting remediation.
</Card>

<Card title="Resolved Vulnerabilities" icon="circle-check">
  Number of findings resolved or marked safe.
</Card>

<Card title="Progress Overview" icon="percent">
  Tracks remediation progress out of total findings.
</Card>

</Columns>

Additional charts such as **Status Distribution** and **Severity Distribution** help visualize vulnerability trends.

## API Endpoints

<Frame caption="API Endpoints Inventory">
  <img src="/images/was/projects/api-endpoints.png" />
</Frame>

The **API Endpoints tab** displays:

- Total requests discovered  
- Total transformed requests  
- Requests sent to the scanner  
- Vulnerabilities found per request  

Each row includes:

- **Endpoint path & host**  
- **Request method (GET, POST, etc.)**  
- **Associated vulnerabilities by severity**  

Filters allow sorting by:

- Severity  
- HTTP method  
- Whether vulnerabilities exist  

This is essential for understanding the attack surface and identifying high-risk endpoints.

---

## Transformed Requests

<Frame caption="Transformed Requests View">
  <img src="/images/was/projects/transformed-requests.png" />
</Frame>

Transformed Requests show all mutated, enhanced, or AI-generated variations derived from original traffic.  

These help simulate:

- Edge cases  
- Unexpected payload behaviors  
- Authentication bypass attempts  
- Input rewriting  

Useful for improving test depth and coverage.

---

## Vulnerabilities

<Frame caption="Vulnerability Listing">
  <img src="/images/was/projects/vulnerabilities.png" />
</Frame>

All identified vulnerabilities appear here once a scan runs.

Features include:

- Severity badges  
- State (Open / Resolved)  
- Detection timestamps  
- Endpoint association  
- Detailed findings after expansion  

If no vulnerabilities exist, the system displays an onboarding prompt to **Start a Scan**.

## Configure

<Frame caption="Project Configuration Panel">
  <img src="/images/was/projects/configure.png" />
</Frame>

The **Configure tab** defines how the scanner interacts with your application.

### **Application Information**

- **Target URL**  
- **Application Name**  
- **Owner**  
- **Tags**  

### **Scanning Scope**

Define include/exclude patterns using scope rules.

### **Authentication**

Upload Playwright authentication scripts to enable authenticated scans.

Includes:

- File upload interface  
- String-based authentication validation logic  

### **Crawler Settings**

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Aggressive" icon="bolt">
  Fast, comprehensive crawling with maximum coverage.
</Card>

<Card title="Intelligent (AI)" icon="robot">
  AI-guided crawling that prioritizes important paths.
</Card>

</Columns>

### **Webhook URL**

Send vulnerability results to external systems.

### **Scan Rules**

Enable or disable detection categories such as:

- Security Headers  
- Authentication Bypass  
- Directory Traversal  
- XSS (Stored / Reflected)  
- Open Redirect  
- Server Error Leaks  

Each rule can be toggled individually.
