The **Projects** module is the central workspace for the Web Application Scanner (WAS)**.  
Each project contains its own set of API endpoints, vulnerabilities, scanning configuration, crawler rules, and transformed requests.  
You must create a project before performing scans, importing traffic, or viewing vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The **Projects** page displays all WAS projects along with:

- Project name  
- Description  
- Started date  
- Owner  
- Quick actions  

Projects serve as isolated workspaces where you configure scanning, analyze vulnerabilities, and review security findings per application.

## Creating a Project

<Frame caption="Create Project Modal">
  <img src="/images/was/products/create-project.png" />
</Frame>

To create a new WAS project:

1. Click **Create Project**.  
2. Enter the project **Name**.  
3. Add a **Description** (optional).  
4. Select relevant **Collections** (if applicable).  
5. Click **Create** to generate the project.

Newly created projects appear instantly in the Projects list.

## Project Workspace

Selecting a project opens the full **Project Workspace**, which contains multiple sections:

  <img src="/images/was/products/project-metrics.png" />
</Frame>

The workspace includes:

- **Metrics**
- **API Endpoints**
- **Transformed Requests**
- **Vulnerabilities**
- **Configure**
- **Crawler Settings**

---

# 📊 Project Sections

---

## Metrics


The **Metrics** tab provides project-wide insights:

- Pending vs resolved vulnerabilities  
- Severity distribution (Critical / High / Medium / Low)  
- Total identified vulnerabilities  
- Visual charts for status and severity  

This gives a real-time health snapshot of the application’s risk.

---

## API Endpoints

<Frame caption="API Endpoints Table">
  <img src="/images/was/products/api-endpoints.png" />
</Frame>

Displays every captured API request, including:

- HTTP Method  
- Host  
- Path  
- Total vulnerabilities for that endpoint  
- Filters (severity, method, has vulnerabilities, etc.)  

Used to analyze coverage and identify vulnerable endpoints.

---

## Transformed Requests

<Frame caption="Transformed Requests Table">
  <img src="/images/was/products/transformed-requests.png" />
</Frame>

Shows normalized/processed versions of API requests that the scanner uses internally.

Includes:

- Endpoint  
- Method  
- Host  
- Vulnerability summary  

Useful for understanding scanner processing and request transformation depth.

---

## Vulnerabilities

<Frame caption="Project Vulnerabilities View">
  <img src="/images/was/products/vulnerabilities.png" />
</Frame>

The **Vulnerabilities** tab displays:

- Vulnerability Title  
- Status (Active, Suppressed)  
- Scan Name  
- Severity  
- First Detected / Last Detected  
- Quick Actions (view, suppress, etc.)  

This is the primary interface for triaging and responding to findings.

---

## Configure

<Frame caption="Project Configuration Panel">
  <img src="/images/was/products/configure.png" />
</Frame>

Used to set up:

### Application Information
- Target URL  
- Application Name  
- Owner  
- Tags  

### Scanning Scope
Add scope rules limiting what the scanner tests.

### Authentication
- Upload Playwright authentication scripts  
- Add success-detection logic (string match)

### Crawler Settings
Choose between:
- **Aggressive mode**  
- **Intelligent (AI-powered) mode**  

---

## Crawler Rules & Webhook Settings

<Frame caption="Crawler Rules & Webhook Settings">
  <img src="/images/was/products/crawler-settings.png" />
</Frame>

Includes:

- **Webhook URL** for receiving vulnerability notifications  
- **Rule activation toggles** for specific checks:
  - Missing Security Headers  
  - Authentication Bypass  
  - Server Error Leak  
  - Directory Traversal  
  - XSS Indicators  
  - Command Injection  
  - SQL Injection  
  - And more…

These rules control what the WAS engine tests during scans.
