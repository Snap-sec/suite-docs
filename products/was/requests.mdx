The **Requests** module gives you full visibility into every API request captured during scanning, whether imported from Postman, proxy traffic, or runtime discovery.  
It provides detailed filtering, vulnerability indicators, request metadata, and workspace-level organization.

## Overview

The **Requests** section displays all API requests associated with your application or project.  
It allows you to:

- Inspect request URLs, methods, and workspaces  
- Identify requests that contain vulnerabilities  
- Filter based on severity, method, vulnerability presence, or workspace  
- Track which collection or integration the request originated from  
- Quickly understand vulnerability counts (Critical, High, Medium, Low) per request

## Key Table Metrics

<Columns cols={4}>

<Card title="Request Name" icon="file-lines">
  Displays the HTTP operation and endpoint path (e.g., `GET /api/v1/user`).
</Card>

<Card title="Method" icon="bolt">
  Indicates the HTTP method — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
</Card>

<Card title="URL" icon="link">
  Shows the full URL where the request was executed.
</Card>

<Card title="Workspace" icon="layer-group">
  Identifies the workspace or environment this request belongs to.
</Card>

</Columns>

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Collection Name" icon="folder-tree">
  Specifies where the request originated — Postman, imported API spec, or auto-discovery.
</Card>

<Card title="Has Vulnerabilities" icon="shield-halved">
  Displays vulnerability severity badges: Critical (C), High (H), Medium (M), Low (L).
</Card>

<Card title="Filters & Search" icon="magnifying-glass">
  Search by endpoint, filter by method, severity, presence of vulnerabilities, or workspace.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Filters & Search

The request table provides powerful filtering options:

- **Search** → Search by URL, request name, or any keyword  
- **Method Filter** → GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.  
- **Severity Filter** → Show requests containing Critical, High, Medium, or Low vulnerabilities  
- **Has Vulnerabilities Filter** → Quickly isolate risky endpoints  
- **Workspace Filter** → Limit requests to a specific workspace  

These filters make it easy to isolate attack vectors or review specific API behavior.

## Understanding Vulnerability Badges

<Frame caption="Vulnerability Badges per Request">
  <img src="/images/was/products/requests-vulns.png" />
</Frame>

Each request displays severity badges:
- **C0** → Critical findings  
- **H0** → High findings  
- **M2** → Medium findings  
- **L0** → Low findings  

A badge count of **0** means no vulnerabilities of that severity were found.

## Use Cases

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Troubleshoot API Behavior" icon="stethoscope">
  Inspect individual requests to understand failures, misconfigurations, or inconsistent responses.
</Card>

<Card title="Locate Vulnerable Endpoints" icon="bug">
  Filter for requests containing vulnerabilities to prioritize remediation.
</Card>

<Card title="Validate Scan Coverage" icon="chart-area">
  View all traffic captured to ensure the scanner crawled and tested your entire API surface.
</Card>

<Card title="Analyze Collections" icon="folder-open">
  Compare imported Postman requests with runtime-discovered requests.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Example Row Breakdown

A typical request entry includes:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | `GET /apiesec/api/v1/vulnerabilities` |
| **Method** | GET |
| **URL** | Full request URL |
| **Collection Name** | e.g., "new project", "Postman", etc. |
| **Vulnerability Summary** | C0 / H0 / M4 / L0 |
| **Workspace Name** | e.g., "new project" |
