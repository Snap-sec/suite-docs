## Overview

The **Web Application Scanner (WAS) Dashboard** provides a unified, real-time view of your application’s security health — including vulnerability distribution, endpoints analyzed, active rules, and scan activity.  
It serves as the central location for understanding your exposure, tracking trends, and prioritizing remediation.

## Overview

The WAS Dashboard aggregates data from:
- API request analysis  
- Automated security scans  
- Rule-based vulnerability detections  
- Endpoint discovery  

It presents the overall security posture across:
- **Total Endpoints**
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Total Rules Active**
- **Total Scans Executed**

This allows teams to track detection quality, exposure trends, and rule effectiveness.

## Visual Analytics & Security Trends

### Vulnerability Severity Distribution

<Frame caption="Severity Distribution Chart">
  <img src="/images/was/products/severity-chart.png" />
</Frame>

Displays vulnerability distribution across:
- Critical  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  
- Informational  

This helps security teams estimate the immediate remediation workload.

---

### CWE Distribution

<Frame caption="CWE Classification Chart">
  <img src="/images/was/products/cwe-distribution.png" />
</Frame>

Shows how vulnerabilities group under standardized CWE categories (e.g., CWE-284: Improper Access Control), helping teams understand recurring weakness patterns.

---

### Open/Closed Vulnerabilities

<Frame caption="Open vs Closed Vulnerabilities">
  <img src="/images/was/products/open-close.png" />
</Frame>

Helps track remediation progress and backlog by showing:
- Active vulnerabilities  
- Resolved vulnerabilities  

---

## Top Vulnerabilities

<Frame caption="Top Vulnerabilities Table">
  <img src="/images/was/products/top-vulns.png" />
</Frame>

Highlights:
- Most frequent vulnerabilities  
- Affected endpoints  
- Severity  
- Detection timestamps  

This prioritizes what needs immediate attention.

Columns include:
- **Title**
- **State**
- **Severity**
- **First Detected**
- **Reported On**
