The **Threat Mitigation** workspace helps teams validate, remediate, and verify threats effectively.  
It centralizes exploitation evidence, remediation steps, replayable request data, and lifecycle tracking — ensuring no threat is overlooked during mitigation.

## Overview

Threat Mitigation provides a full-resolution workflow for each identified threat, combining:

- Technical analysis  
- Reproduction steps  
- Remediation guidance  
- Team ownership & collaboration  
- Evidence attachments  
- Lifecycle and activity history  

This ensures developers and security teams work together efficiently to eliminate risks.

## Mitigation Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Threat Details" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Analyze the threat description, impacted endpoints, severity, CWE category, and attack scenario.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Evidence" icon="file-shield">
    Inspect captured requests, payloads, parameters, and attached proof to validate the risk.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Fix or Patch" icon="wrench">
    Developers apply backend, permission, validation, or logic fixes to remove the vulnerability.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark as Ready for Verification" icon="clipboard-check">
    Once developers push the fix, the threat moves to **Fix Verified** for security review.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-Test Automatically" icon="rotate-right">
    Snapsec automatically replays the threat scenario to validate the fix.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Close the Threat" icon="circle-check">
    If validation passes, the threat is marked **Resolved** with a complete audit trail.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Search, Filtering & Sorting

Threat Mitigation supports advanced investigation controls:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Severity** | Critical, High, Medium, or Low threats |
| **State** | Acknowledged, In Progress, Fixed, Verified |
| **Owner** | Filter by responsible developer or analyst |
| **Endpoint** | API route or functionality impacted |
