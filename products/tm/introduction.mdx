## Overview

**Snapsec Threat Modeler** revolutionizes API security by automating the discovery of potential attack vectors — before they’re exploited.  
By integrating seamlessly with tools like **Postman**, it analyzes API requests, detects insecure patterns, and automatically generates potential exploit scenarios.

Whether it’s **IDOR**, **SQL Injection**, or **Authentication Bypass**, Threat Modeler uses AI-driven logic to simulate real-world threats and turn them into actionable insights for your security and development teams.

## Why Threat Modeler?

Traditional vulnerability scanners often detect issues after they’re introduced — **Threat Modeler** focuses on prevention and early prediction.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Postman" icon="link">
    Integrate your Postman workspace to fetch APIs and endpoints directly into Threat Modeler.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AI Threat Simulation" icon="brain">
    The system automatically analyzes API request parameters and generates simulated attacks such as IDORs, SQLi, and command injections.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate & Assign" icon="circle-check">
    Each generated threat becomes a ticket that teams can validate, confirm, or dismiss.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remediate & Report" icon="chart-simple">
    Track progress, export reports, and measure mitigation trends through rich dashboards.
  </Step>

## Example Use Case

For a given API request:

```text
GET /api/users?id=1
```

Threat Modeler automatically simulates potential threats like:

- **IDOR:** `/api/users?id=<other_user_id>`  
- **SQL Injection:** `/api/users?id=1' OR '1'='1'--`  
- **Command Injection:** `/api/users?id=;cat /etc/passwd`

Each of these simulated payloads becomes an **AI-generated threat ticket**, ready for developer validation or retesting.
