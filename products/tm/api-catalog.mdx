The **API Catalog** provides a unified registry of every API endpoint discovered across your applications and services.
It enables complete visibility into routes, methods, linked threats, metadata, and real-time behavioral insights — powering accurate threat modelling and secure API development.

## Overview

The API Catalog aggregates all endpoints detected through:
- Postman collections  
- Swagger/OpenAPI specifications  
- Threat-generation scans  
- Application imports  
- Live traffic datasets (where applicable)

Each API entry contains:
- **Route path**  
- **HTTP method**  
- **Host/service association**  
- **Threat count & severity**  
- **Generation state**  
- **Metadata & parameters**  
- **Linked project**  

This catalog acts as the **source of truth** for API attack surface discovery and threat modelling.

## Search, Filters & Sorting

The powerful API filtering system lets analysts narrow down endpoints by:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Method** | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. |
| **Threats** | Filter by severity or count |
| **Owner** | Assigned engineering team |
| **Path Contains** | Partial route matching |
| **Generation State** | Generated, Pending, Failed |
| **Tags** | Custom metadata |
| **Project** | Associated application or service |

Filters can be combined for deep investigation.

## API Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Route** | API path including dynamic parameters |
| **Method** | HTTP verb for the endpoint |
| **Host / Service** | Linked backend service |
| **Threat Count** | Total threats mapped to this endpoint |
| **State** | Generation status (Generated, Pending, Skipped) |
| **Owner** | Assigned team or engineer |
| **Tags** | API-specific metadata |
| **Detected On** | First and last discovery timestamps |

Each endpoint includes:

### API Summary
- Method  
- Route path  
- Host/service  
- Threat count & severity breakdown  
- Environment  
- Status (active, deprecated)  

### Threat Insights
- Threat severity distribution  
- Linked threat details  
- State progression  
- References & audit log  

### Parameters & Payloads
- Query parameters  
- Path parameters  
- Body schemas  
- Expected inputs  

### Associations
- Linked services  
- Related endpoints  
- Shared components  

---

## API Lifecycle Controls

Each endpoint supports:

- **Assign Owner** — map route to responsible service team  
- **Regenerate Threats** — refresh threat modelling logic  
- **Archive Endpoint** — mark route as deprecated  
- **Delete Endpoint** — remove invalid or outdated entries  

All actions synchronize across the Threat Modelling module.

## How API Endpoints Are Discovered

Snapsec identifies API endpoints using:

- **Postman Adapter** — imports and syncs Postman collections  
- **Swagger / OpenAPI Adapter** — parses API definitions  
- **Threat Generator** — discovers new routes through modelling  
- **App Imports** — APIs linked from projects  
- **Manual additions** — user-created endpoints  

Endpoints are continuously updated as APIs evolve.
