Snapsec's Threat Modeling module integrates seamlessly with **Swagger** and **Postman** through dedicated adapters.  
These integrations automate endpoint discovery, reduce manual effort, and keep threat models continuously updated as APIs evolve.


---

## Overview

Threat Modeling becomes significantly more accurate and efficient when API schemas and request collections flow into the system automatically.

Snapsec supports two primary adapter-driven integrations:

<Check> **Swagger Integration (via Adapter)** </Check>  
<Check> **Postman Integration (via Adapter)** </Check>

These adapters import, sync, and refresh API routes — ensuring your threat models always reflect the latest system behavior.

## Swagger Integration (Adapter-Driven)

  <img src="/images/tm/integrations-swagger.png" />
</Frame>

Swagger/OpenAPI files help identify:
- Endpoints  
- HTTP methods  
- Request/response schemas  
- Parameter and authentication details  

### What the Adapter Does

- Imports OpenAPI/Swagger specs directly into Snapsec  
- Discovers all API paths, parameters, and operations  
- Syncs updated swagger files without manual re-upload  
- Auto-generates threat scenarios for newly detected endpoints  
- Flags outdated or missing Swagger definitions  

### Ideal For  
Teams using OpenAPI-first or schema-driven API development.

---

## Postman Integration (Adapter-Driven)

<Frame caption="Postman Integration Overview">
  <img src="/images/tm/integrations-postman.png" />
</Frame>

Postman collections represent real-world API behavior and testing flows.

### What the Adapter Does

- Syncs Postman collections into the Threat Modeling workspace  
- Extracts endpoints, variables, headers, and authentication  
- Detects dynamic request flows and chained operations  
- Auto-maps threats to each Postman-defined request  
- Tracks changes in collections over time  

### Ideal For  
Teams that manage APIs through Postman or use it for internal testing.
