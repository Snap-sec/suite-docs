The **Severity Distribution** view helps teams instantly understand the threat landscape by categorizing findings into Critical, High, Medium, and Low severity levels.  
This gives a clear snapshot of overall project risk and highlights where attention is needed most.

## Overview

Severity Distribution provides a **project-wide risk snapshot**, showing how threats are distributed across severity categories.

This allows teams to quickly identify:

- Whether Critical or High severity threats dominate  
- Which services or endpoints carry the highest impact  
- How severity changes over time as threats are added, triaged, or resolved  
- Imbalances pointing to systemic design flaws or weak areas  

It is the fastest way to measure the **risk concentration** inside any system.

## Why Severity Distribution Matters

<Check>
  Ensures teams prioritize high-impact threats first  
</Check>

<Check>
  Helps engineering estimate workload and remediation timelines  
</Check>

<Check>
  Surfaces systemic weaknesses in architecture  
</Check>

<Check>
  Offers leadership a clear, data-driven view of project risk posture  
</Check>

Severity is one of the strongest indicators of where **security debt** is accumulating.

## How Snapsec Calculates Severity

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Threat Metadata" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Severity is determined based on exploitability, impact, environment, and system context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply CWE & OWASP Mappings" icon="book">
    Severity levels align with industry standards mapped to CWE and OWASP categories.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Account for Exposure" icon="shield-halved">
    Threats affecting exposed or public-facing endpoints may be bumped to higher severity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continuous Recalculation" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Severity updates as endpoints, conditions, or system behavior changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>
