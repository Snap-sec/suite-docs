<Banner>
The **Projects** module gives teams a unified workspace to model threats across APIs, microservices, and applications.
Each project consolidates endpoints, threat logs, collaborators, and progress analytics — allowing teams to perform
systematic, repeatable, and collaborative threat modeling.

## Overview

Threat Modeling **Projects** act as dedicated workspaces for analyzing application components, API endpoints, and security risks.

Each project contains:

- API endpoint inventory  
- Automatically generated threat findings  
- Threat severity & confidence analytics  
- Project-level completion status  
- Collaborators & permissions  
- Workload distribution and ownership  

Projects allow security teams to break large applications into manageable units and model each component efficiently.

## Key Metrics & Insights

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Total Endpoints" icon="network-wired">
  Total API endpoints included in the modeling scope of the project.
</Card>

<Card title="Total Threats" icon="shield-halved">
  Count of all identified or generated threats across the project.
</Card>

<Card title="Progress Status" icon="chart-line">
  Tracks how much threat analysis is completed for the project.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Project Workspace

<Frame caption="Project Workspace View">
  <img src="/images/tm/projects2.png" />
</Frame>

Each project card displays:

- **Project title & description**  
- **Total endpoints**  
- **Total threats**  
- **Collaborators**  
- **Started date**  
- **Progress bar showing modeling completion**  

This allows stakeholders to triage and prioritize projects at a glance.

---

## Project Details

Inside each project, users gain access to multiple components:

### 🔹 API Endpoints  
A complete list of scanned or manually added endpoints including:  
- Method  
- Host  
- Path  
- Threat count  
- Threat status  

### 🔹 Threats  
Auto-generated or manually added threats appear with:  
- Severity  
- Confidence  
- Owners  
- State (Pending, Acknowledged, In Progress, etc.)  

### 🔹 Metrics  
Charts summarizing threat severity distribution, status counts, and resolver workload.

### 🔹 Collaborators  
A view to manage project-level permissions and designate threat owners.

# ⭐ **Project Setup Actions**  
These are the first actions users perform after creating or opening a project.

---

## Create a Project

<Frame caption="Create a New Project">
  <img src="/images/tm/create-project.png" />
</Frame>

To begin threat modeling:

1. Go to **Threat Management → Projects**.  
2. Click **Create Project**.  
3. Enter:
   - **Project Name**
   - **Description**
4. Click **Create** to initialize your workspace.

A new project appears with zero endpoints and zero threats until data is added.

---

## Import Endpoints

<Frame caption="Import Endpoints from Postman">
  <img src="/images/tm/import-endpoints.png" />
</Frame>

Use the **Import Endpoints** feature to onboard API endpoints into your project.

Supported format:
- **Postman JSON collections**

Steps:
1. Click **Browse** and upload a Postman collection.  
2. Endpoints are automatically extracted.  
3. Click **Import Endpoints** to add them to the project.

This provides an instant starting point for threat modeling without manual data entry.

---

## Import Threats

<Frame caption="Import Threats">
  <img src="/images/tm/import-threats.png" />
</Frame>

You can import previously generated threats directly into a project.

Supported file type:
- **JSON** (Snapsec exported threat format)

Steps:
1. Click **Import Threats** inside the project.  
2. Upload your `.json` threat file.  
3. Threats are mapped to endpoints and added immediately.

This is useful for migrating between projects or reusing existing threat libraries.

---

## Create Manual Threat

<Frame caption="Create Manual Threat">
  <img src="/images/tm/manual-threat.png" />
</Frame>

If you want to define a threat manually:

1. Inside a project, click **Create Manual Threat**.  
2. Fill in:
   - Threat title  
   - Description  
   - Severity  
   - Confidence  
   - Mitigation  
   - References  
3. Click **Save** to add it to the project.

Manual threats allow teams to document design flaws, business logic risks, or situations not detected automatically.

---

## Project Roles & Collaboration

Teams can add collaborators with specific roles:

- **Owner** — full access; responsible for all threat approvals  
- **Manager** — can analyze threats, assign owners, and update states  
- **Member** — can review and assist in threat analysis  

<Frame caption="Project Collaborator Controls">
  <img src="/images/tm/projects4.png" />
</Frame>

Roles help define clear responsibility boundaries across the team.

---

## Threat Generation Workflow

Each project integrates automated threat modeling:

- AI analyzes API requests  
- Threats are generated using structured rules  
- Each threat includes:
  - Title  
  - Explanation  
  - Severity  
  - Confidence  
  - Practical mitigations  
  - OWASP & CWE mappings  
  - References

This ensures repeatable, consistent modeling without manual guesswork.
