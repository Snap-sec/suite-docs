## Overview

The **Projects** section in Threat Modeler serves as your workspace for managing multiple API threat modeling initiatives.  
Each project represents a collection of API endpoints imported from Postman or manually defined, where AI simulates potential threats, tracks validation, and monitors remediation progress.

## Creating a Project

You can start a new threat modeling project by defining its name and description.  
Each project can later sync with Postman collections or other API sources for automated endpoint ingestion.

### Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Projects" icon="rectangle-list">
    Open **Threat Management → Projects** from the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Create Project'" icon="plus">
    A dialog appears allowing you to name and describe your new project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add API Sources" icon="link">
    Once created, connect Postman or upload endpoint files for automated analysis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Threat Modeling" icon="shield">
    The system will begin generating AI-based attack simulations on your endpoints.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deleting a Project

If a project is no longer needed, you can safely delete it from your workspace.  
Deleting a project will remove all related threat records and analysis results.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate Project" icon="search">
    Go to the **Projects** page and find the project you want to delete.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Project Options" icon="ellipsis-vertical">
    Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the project card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Delete Project" icon="trash">
    Confirm the deletion when prompted. This action is irreversible.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Threats in CSV

Export threats from any project into a CSV file for further analysis, reporting, or sharing with external teams.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Project" icon="folder-open">
    Go to the **Threats** tab inside the desired project.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Export" icon="download">
    Select **Export CSV** from the toolbar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Filters (Optional)" icon="filter">
    You can filter threats by severity, status, or validation state before exporting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download the File" icon="file-csv">
    The system generates and downloads a `.csv` file containing all selected threat data.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Overview & Metrics

Each project dashboard provides a full view of your threat modeling activity, including endpoint counts, identified threats, workload, and severity distribution.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Endpoints** | Number of API routes under analysis. |
| **Total Threats** | Total number of AI-generated and manually validated threat hypotheses. |
| **Pending / Acknowledged / Fixed** | Live breakdown of each threat’s resolution state. |
| **Severity Distribution** | Criticality spread across identified vulnerabilities. |
| **Workload** | Shows the current progress of threat validation tasks. |

## Best Practices

- Create one project per microservice, API group, or environment for cleaner analysis.  
- Assign dedicated owners for each project to maintain accountability.  
- Use metrics and severity charts to identify high-risk APIs early.  
- Archive completed projects to retain visibility into historical threats.

</Frame>

### Inviting Collaborators to Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings" icon="gear">
    Inside your project, click **Project Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Collaborator" icon="user-plus">
    In **Update Collaborators**, pick a user from the **Collaborators** dropdown (searchable) and select a **Role** (e.g., *Viewer*, *Triager*, *Owner*).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Collaborator" icon="circle-check">
    Click **Update Collaborator** to grant access immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Removing Collaborators

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Member" icon="users">
    In **Project Settings**, locate the member in the collaborators table.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Change Role or Remove" icon="user-minus">
    Use the action menu to **remove** the collaborator or downgrade their role.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm" icon="shield">
    Confirm the change. Access is revoked instantly and outstanding tickets remain assigned for auditability.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting a Default Threat Owner

Automatically route all **newly generated threats** to a default assignee for quicker triage.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Default Threat Owner" icon="id-badge">
    In **Project Settings**, scroll to **Default Threat Owner**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select a Member" icon="user-check">
    Choose the teammate who should receive new threats by default (can be changed later per ticket).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save" icon="floppy-disk">
    Click **Save/Update** to apply routing. Existing threats remain unchanged.
  </Step>
</Steps>
