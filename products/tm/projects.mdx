The **Projects** module gives teams a unified workspace to model threats across APIs, microservices, and applications.
Each project consolidates endpoints, threat logs, collaborators, and progress analytics — allowing teams to perform
systematic, repeatable, and collaborative threat modeling.

## Overview

Threat Modeling **Projects** act as dedicated workspaces for analyzing application components, API endpoints, and security risks.

Each project contains:

- API endpoint inventory  
- Automatically generated threat findings  
- Threat severity & confidence analytics  
- Project-level completion status  
- Collaborators & permissions  
- Workload distribution and ownership  

Projects allow security teams to break large applications into manageable units and model each component efficiently.

## Key Metrics & Insights

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Total Endpoints" icon="network-wired">
  Total API endpoints included in the modeling scope of the project.
</Card>

<Card title="Total Threats" icon="shield-halved">
  Count of all identified or generated threats across the project.
</Card>

<Card title="Progress Status" icon="chart-line">
  Tracks how much threat analysis is completed for the project.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Project Workspace

<Frame caption="Project Workspace View">
  <img src="/images/tm/projects2.png" />
</Frame>

Each project card displays:

- **Project title & description**  
- **Total endpoints**  
- **Total threats**  
- **Collaborators**  
- **Started date**  
- **Progress bar showing modeling completion**  

This allows stakeholders to triage and prioritize projects at a glance.

## Creating a Project

The **Create Project** workflow allows teams to quickly initialize a new threat-modeling workspace.  
A project acts as the primary container for endpoints, threats, collaborators, and modeling insights.

## How Project Creation Works

When creating a new project, users must provide:

### **1. Project Name**
A unique identifier for the project, typically the service name or API domain.  
Examples:
- `User Authentication Service`
- `Order Management API`
- `Payments Gateway`

### **2. Description**
A human-readable explanation of the system being modeled.  
This field helps collaborators understand:
- What the project covers  
- Stakeholder responsibilities  
- Any assumptions or constraints  

### **3. Select Collections**
Collections represent imported request sources such as:
- Postman workspaces  
- Swagger/OAS specifications  
- WAS request captures  

Selecting a collection allows the system to automatically pull API requests into the project.

## Fields in the Create Project Form

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Name" icon="tag">
  The required project name used for identification across the dashboard.
</Card>

<Card title="Description" icon="align-left">
  Optional but recommended summary describing system scope and purpose.
</Card>

<Card title="Collections" icon="folder-tree">
  Select one or more request sources to import API endpoints into the project.
</Card>

</Columns>

---

## Example Workflow

1. Click **Create Project** from the Projects dashboard.
2. Enter a meaningful **project name**.
3. Add a detailed **description** (recommended for large teams).
4. Use the dropdown to **select request collections**.
5. Click **Create**.

Once created, you will be redirected to the **Project Workspace**, where you can:
- View imported API endpoints  
- Begin automated threat generation  
- Assign collaborators  
- Track modeling progress

## Best Practices for Creating Projects

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Use Clear Names" icon="pen-to-square">
  Avoid vague names like *Service 1*. Use descriptive labels tied to real system boundaries.
</Card>

<Card title="Define Scope Early" icon="bullseye">
  Clearly describe what is in scope (e.g., user flows, API modules, components).
</Card>

<Card title="Attach the Right Collections" icon="folder-plus">
  Always link the collection containing your live or relevant API requests.
</Card>

<Card title="Add Collaborators Immediately" icon="users-gear">
  Assign owners early to ensure timely threat review and mitigation.
</Card>

</Columns>

## Project Details

Inside each project, users gain access to multiple components:

### 🔹 API Endpoints  
A complete list of scanned or manually added endpoints including:  
- Method  
- Host  
- Path  
- Threat count  
- Threat status  

### 🔹 Threats  
Auto-generated or manually added threats appear with:  
- Severity  
- Confidence  
- Owners  
- State (Pending, Acknowledged, In Progress, etc.)  

### 🔹 Metrics  
Charts summarizing threat severity distribution, status counts, and resolver workload.

### 🔹 Collaborators  
A view to manage project-level permissions and designate threat owners.

## Project Roles & Collaboration

Teams can add collaborators with specific roles:

- **Owner** — full access; responsible for all threat approvals  
- **Manager** — can analyze threats, assign owners, and update states  
- **Member** — can review and assist in threat analysis  

<Frame caption="Project Collaborator Controls">
  <img src="/images/tm/projects4.png" />
</Frame>

Roles help define clear responsibility boundaries across the team.

## Threat Generation Workflow

Each project integrates automated threat modeling:

- AI analyzes API requests  
- Threats are generated using structured rules  
- Each threat includes:
  - Title  
  - Explanation  
  - Severity  
  - Confidence  
  - Practical mitigations  
  - OWASP & CWE mappings  
  - References

</Frame>

This ensures repeatable, consistent modeling without manual guesswork.

---

## Dashboard-Level Visibility

The Threat Modeling **Dashboard** aggregates data from all projects:

<Frame caption="Threat Modeling Dashboard Overview">
  <img src="/images/tm/projects6.png" />
</Frame>

It provides global insights such as:

- Total threats across all projects  
- Pending vs In Progress vs Verified  
- Severity distribution (Critical / High / Medium / Low)  
- Per-project threat breakdown  
- CWE classification across large datasets
