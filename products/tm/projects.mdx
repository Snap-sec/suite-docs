The **Projects** module gives teams a unified workspace to model threats across APIs, microservices, and applications.
Each project consolidates endpoints, threat logs, collaborators, and progress analytics — allowing teams to perform
systematic, repeatable, and collaborative threat modeling.

## Overview

Threat Modeling **Projects** act as dedicated workspaces for analyzing application components, API endpoints, and security risks.

Each project contains:

- API endpoint inventory  
- Automatically generated threat findings  
- Threat severity & confidence analytics  
- Project-level completion status  
- Collaborators & permissions  
- Workload distribution and ownership  

Projects allow security teams to break large applications into manageable units and model each component efficiently.

## Project Workspace

<Frame caption="Project Workspace View">
  <img src="/images/tm/projects2.png" />
</Frame>

Each project card displays:

- **Project title & description**  
- **Total endpoints**  
- **Total threats**  
- **Collaborators**  
- **Started date**  
- **Progress bar showing modeling completion**  

This allows stakeholders to triage and prioritize projects at a glance.

## Project Details

Inside each project, users gain access to multiple components:

### 🔹 API Endpoints  
A complete list of scanned or manually added endpoints including:  
- Method  
- Host  
- Path  
- Threat count  
- Threat status  

### 🔹 Threats  
Auto-generated or manually added threats appear with:  
- Severity  
- Confidence  
- Owners  
- State (Pending, Acknowledged, In Progress, etc.)  

### 🔹 Metrics  
Charts summarizing threat severity distribution, status counts, and resolver workload.

### 🔹 Collaborators  
A view to manage project-level permissions and designate threat owners.

## Project Roles & Collaboration

Teams can add collaborators with specific roles:

- **Owner** — full access; responsible for all threat approvals  
- **Manager** — can analyze threats, assign owners, and update states  
- **Member** — can review and assist in threat analysis

Roles help define clear responsibility boundaries across the team.

## Threat Generation Workflow

Each project integrates automated threat modeling:

- AI analyzes API requests  
- Threats are generated using structured rules  
- Each threat includes:
  - Title  
  - Explanation  
  - Severity  
  - Confidence  
  - Practical mitigations  
  - OWASP & CWE mappings  
  - References

This ensures repeatable, consistent modeling without manual guesswork.

## Dashboard-Level Visibility

The Threat Modeling **Dashboard** aggregates data from all projects:

  <img src="/images/tm/projects6.png" />
</Frame>

It provides global insights such as:

- Total threats across all projects  
- Pending vs In Progress vs Verified  
- Severity distribution (Critical / High / Medium / Low)  
- Per-project threat breakdown  
- CWE classification across large datasets
