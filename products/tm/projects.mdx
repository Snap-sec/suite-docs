The **Projects** module gives teams a unified workspace to model threats across APIs, microservices, and applications.
Each project consolidates endpoints, threat logs, collaborators, and progress analytics — allowing teams to perform
systematic, repeatable, and collaborative threat modeling.

## Overview

Threat Modeling **Projects** act as dedicated workspaces for analyzing application components, API endpoints, and security risks.

Each project contains:

- API endpoint inventory  
- Automatically generated threat findings  
- Threat severity & confidence analytics  
- Project-level completion status  
- Collaborators & permissions  
- Workload distribution and ownership  

Projects allow security teams to break large applications into manageable units and model each component efficiently.

## Exploring Existing Projects

<Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
  <img src="/images/tm/projects4.png" />
</Frame>

The main Projects page shows a grid of project cards.

Each card displays:

- **Project name** and short description  
- **Total Endpoints** and **Total Threats**  
- **Progress bar** to visualize activity and coverage  
- **Started** date (how long the project has been active)  
- **Owner avatar** to see who is responsible

To open a project, simply **click on its card**.

Inside a project, you can switch between tabs:

- **Metrics** – overview of threats, severity distribution, and progress  
- **API Endpoints** – list of imported endpoints and their threat status  
- **Threats** – all generated or manually created threats  
- **Project Settings** – collaborators and ownership  
- **Admin Settings** – advanced controls for the project

## Importing API Endpoints into a Project

The **API Endpoints** tab is where you centralize all endpoints for a project.

To import endpoints:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to API Endpoints tab">
    Open your project and select the **API Endpoints** tab from the top navigation.

    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects8.png" />
    </Frame>


  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Import API Endpoints">
    Use the **Import** button on the top-right of the endpoints table.

    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects5.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload your source">
    Upload your API definition file (for example, a Postman collection export or similar JSON file).

    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects6.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review imported endpoints">
    After import, endpoints appear in the table with:
    - Endpoint path and name  
    - HTTP method  
    - Host  
    - Total threats  
    - Threat status and actions (re-generate, delete, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
Once endpoints are imported, Threat Modeler can automatically generate threats for them using your configured rules and AI engine.
</Callout>

## Importing Threats from CSV

If you already have threats defined in spreadsheets or another system, you can bulk-import them.

To import threats:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Threats tab">
    Inside your project, go to the **Threats** tab.

    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects9.png" />
    </Frame>


  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Import Threats">
    Use the **Import Threats** button on the top right (CSV import icon).


  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload CSV file">
    Select your CSV file following the expected format (columns such as title, description, severity, state, endpoint mapping, etc.).
    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects11.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm and import">
    Confirm the mapping if prompted and complete the import. All rows will appear as threats in the table.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
CSV import is ideal when migrating from legacy tools or loading a batch of identified threats during onboarding.
</Callout>

## Downloading Threats as CSV

You can export threats to CSV for reporting, sharing with other systems, or offline analysis.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to the Threats tab">
    Open the project Page.

    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects1.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>


  <Step title="Click Download CSV">
    Click on the 3 dots and Then Click on "Export Csv Report".
     <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects13.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the CSV output">
    The generated CSV includes key fields such as:
    - Threat title and description  
    - Severity, state, and confidence  
    - Linked endpoint information  
    - Timestamps and metadata
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding or Removing Collaborators

Collaborators control who can see and manage a project.

To manage collaborators:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    Within a project, click the **Project Settings** tab.

     <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects14.png" />
    </Frame>


  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a collaborator">

     <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects15.png" />
    </Frame>

    In the **Update Collaborators** section:
    - Choose a user from the **Collaborators** dropdown  
    - Select a **Role** (Owner, Editor, or Viewer)  
    - Click **Update Collaborator**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove a collaborator">
    In the collaborators list, click the **trash** icon next to the user you want to remove.

    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects17.png" />
    </Frame>


  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
Use **Owner** for people responsible for security decisions, **Editor** for active contributors, and **Viewer** for stakeholders who only need read-only access.
</Callout>

## Setting a Default Threat Owner

The **Default Threat Owner** is the person who will be assigned as the owner for new threats when no specific owner is specified.

To configure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Project Settings">
    Inside the project, open the **Project Settings** tab.
     <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects14.png" />
    </Frame>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Default Threat Owner">
    In the **Default Threat Owner** section:
    - Select a team member from the dropdown.

    <Frame caption="Threat Modeling Projects Overview">
      <img src="/images/tm/projects18.png" />
    </Frame>


  </Step>

  <Step title="Save the setting">
    Click **Update Default Threat Owner**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="How it works">
    All newly created or imported threats without an explicit owner will be automatically assigned to this member. Ownership can still be changed later on individual threats.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
A default owner ensures that every threat has a clearly responsible person from day one, avoiding “unowned” risks.
</Callout>
