## Overview

The **Departments** module helps organizations structure users into logical business units such as *IT*, *HR*, *Sales*, or *Engineering*.  
Departments act as the **top-level organizational layer**, enabling better ownership, access control, reporting alignment, and team management across Snapsec.

Each department can contain multiple teams, department leads, and members—allowing security operations to scale cleanly across large organizations.
