## Overview

The **Company Profile** section defines your organization’s identity inside Snapsec.  
It acts as the authoritative source for company-level information that appears across reports, dashboards, exports, and shared assets.

This configuration ensures that every security artifact generated from Snapsec—whether internal or external—correctly represents your organization with consistent metadata and branding.

### General Information

This section captures core organizational identifiers used for governance, reporting, and compliance.

**Fields included:**
- **Company Name** — Official organization name displayed across the platform.

- **VAT Number** — Tax identifier used for billing and regulatory documentation.
- **Registration Number** — Legal business registration reference.

These details help ensure traceability and accuracy when generating executive reports, audit exports, or compliance evidence.

### Branding

Branding settings control how your organization is visually represented across Snapsec-generated content.

**Branding options include:**

- **Company Logo URL** — External reference for hosted logo assets.
- **Primary Brand Color** — Main accent color used across UI elements and documents.

Branding ensures that all exported reports, PDFs, and shared views maintain your organization’s identity—especially important for client-facing or executive deliverables.
