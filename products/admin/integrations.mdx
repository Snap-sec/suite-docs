## What is QRadar Integration

The **QRadar Integration** allows Snapsec Suite to send all system-generated security and audit events directly to **IBM QRadar SIEM**.

Once connected, QRadar can ingest Snapsec events for:
- Centralized logging
- Correlation with other security signals
- Threat detection and investigations
- Compliance and audit visibility

This integration helps security teams gain **real-time visibility** into activities happening across the Snapsec platform from within their existing SIEM workflows.

## What Events Does Snapsec Send

Snapsec sends **all system events** to QRadar, including but not limited to:

- User management events (create, update, delete)
- Authentication and authorization actions
- Asset changes
- Vulnerability lifecycle events
- Configuration changes
- Integration and automation activities
- Administrative and audit actions

All events are transmitted in a **structured, consistent schema** to ensure reliable parsing and correlation inside QRadar.

---

## Event Schema

Snapsec sends events in JSON format using the following schema:

```json
{
  "type": "audit",
  "action": "create_user",
  "request": {
    "url": "/v1/users",
    "params": {},
    "query": {},
    "headers": {
      "user-agent": "curl/8.0.1"
    }
  },
  "response": {
    "body": {
      "id": "u_123",
      "status": "created"
    },
    "headers": {
      "content-type": "application/json"
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "ip": "203.0.113.10",
    "userId": "admin_1",
    "traceId": "abc-xyz"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-27T10:15:30.000Z"
}
```
