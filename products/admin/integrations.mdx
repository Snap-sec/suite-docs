## Overview

The **Integrations** module allows you to connect Snapsec with **external security tools and platforms** to create a unified, automated security workflow.

Integrations enable Snapsec to **ingest logs, synchronize events, and exchange data** with third-party systems—reducing manual effort and improving visibility across your security stack.

This is especially useful for SOC teams, security engineers, and administrators who rely on multiple tools for monitoring and response.

  />
</Frame>

The Integrations dashboard provides a **central catalog of supported adapters**.

### What You See Here
- **Adapter Name** — External tool or platform (e.g., QRadar)
- **Description** — What data or functionality the integration provides
- **Status Tabs**
  - **Adapters** — Available integrations you can install
  - **Active Adapters** — Currently connected and running integrations
- **Search Bar** — Quickly locate integrations by name or type
- **Install Action** — One-click setup for supported tools

This view gives instant clarity on what integrations are available and which are already active.

## Supported Adapters

Snapsec supports integrations with **security monitoring, logging, and analytics platforms**.

### Example: QRadar Integration
- Synchronizes **security logs and access logs**
- Enables centralized monitoring alongside Snapsec findings
- Helps correlate vulnerabilities, activity, and alerts across systems

As Snapsec evolves, additional adapters can be enabled from this page without changing your existing configuration.

## Installing an Integration

To connect an external tool:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Browse or search for the desired adapter
3. Click **Install**
4. Follow the configuration steps (if required)

Once installed, the integration appears under **Active Adapters**, and data synchronization begins automatically.

---

## Active Integrations

The **Active Adapters** tab shows all integrations currently enabled in your workspace.

### From Here You Can
- Verify integration status
- Monitor connected tools
- Disable or remove adapters when no longer needed

This ensures full control over external data flow and system connections.

## Why Integrations Matter

Integrations extend Snapsec beyond a standalone platform.

- Centralize security data from multiple tools
- Reduce manual log handling and duplication
- Improve incident correlation and response speed
- Maintain a single source of truth for security operations

By connecting Snapsec to your existing ecosystem, teams gain **better context, automation, and operational efficiency**.
