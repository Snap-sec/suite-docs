## Overview

The **Account & Settings** page acts as the central control center for user identity, security posture, and workspace personalization within Snapsec.  
It allows users to manage their personal profile, secure their account, configure preferences, and control notification behavior — all from one unified interface.

This page is designed to balance **usability, security, and governance**, ensuring users can manage their account without impacting organizational controls.

## Personal Information

</Frame>

The **Personal Info** section allows users to manage their individual profile details.

### What You Can Manage
- Profile photo (JPEG / PNG)
- First name and last name
- Basic identity details associated with the account

These details are reflected across assessments, reports, comments, and activity logs to maintain accurate attribution.

## Login & Security

</Frame>

The **Login & Security** section focuses on protecting account access and preventing unauthorized usage.

### Password Management
- Update current password securely
- Enforce confirmation for password changes
- Immediate application across all sessions

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **OTP via Email** — Receive one-time passwords by email
- **Authenticator App (TOTP)** — Use apps like Google Authenticator or Authy

Enabling 2FA significantly reduces the risk of account compromise.
