## Overview

The **Teams** module allows organizations to group users into functional units within departments.  
Teams help define **ownership**, **responsibility**, and **access boundaries** across products, assessments, and workflows.

Each team belongs to a department and can have a designated **team lead**, multiple members, and a clear scope of responsibility.

## Teams List

The Teams page displays all teams configured in the organization, along with their department association and member visibility.

Each team card shows:
- **Team name**
- **Parent department**
- **Short description**
- **Member avatars and count**

This view gives administrators a quick snapshot of how users are organized across the organization.
