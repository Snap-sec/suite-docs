## Overview

The **Security** section provides visibility and control over how users access your Snapsec workspace.  
It is designed to help organizations monitor login activity, identify suspicious behavior, and maintain a complete audit trail of security-relevant actions.

This section answers three critical questions:

- **Who is accessing the workspace?**
- **From which devices and locations?**
- **What actions are being performed?**

Together, these controls help enforce accountability, detect anomalies, and support compliance requirements.

## Current Sessions

</Frame>

The **Current Sessions** view displays all active and recent user logins across the organization.

### What You Can See

- **User identity** — name and role (Admin / Member)  
- **Last login time** — when the session was initiated  
- **Browser & OS** — Chrome, Firefox, Windows, Linux, etc.  
- **Login device** — Desktop or other device types  

This allows administrators to quickly identify:
- Unexpected logins
- Duplicate or concurrent sessions
- Access from unfamiliar platforms

## Device Security

</Frame>

The **Device Security** section focuses on *where* access is coming from.

Each entry represents a device that has successfully authenticated to the workspace.

### Why This Matters

- Helps detect compromised or shared credentials  
- Identifies stale or unused access paths  
- Supports device-level access reviews during audits  

Administrators can regularly review this list to ensure that only trusted devices are accessing sensitive environments.

## Security Logs

</Frame>

**Security Logs** provide a complete, immutable audit trail of actions performed within the platform.

### Logged Information Includes

- **Event title** — what action occurred  
- **User** — who performed the action  
- **HTTP method** — GET, POST, PUT, etc.  
- **Action type** — read, write, update  
- **Origin & URL** — API or UI source  
- **IP address** — source of the request  
- **Timestamp** — exact time of activity  

These logs are essential for:
- Incident investigations  
- Compliance and audit reviews  
- Detecting misuse or abnormal behavior

## Why This Matters

Security is not just about prevention — it is about **visibility and traceability**.

By combining session monitoring, device awareness, and detailed logs, Snapsec enables organizations to:

- Detect suspicious access early  
- Enforce accountability across teams  
- Maintain compliance with security and audit standards  
- Respond faster during security incidents  

This turns workspace access from a blind spot into a **controlled, observable system**.
