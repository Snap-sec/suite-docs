## Overview

The **API Keys** module allows organizations to securely authenticate applications, adapters, and integrations with Snapsec.  
API keys act as a **trusted access mechanism**, enabling programmatic communication between Snapsec services and external systems without exposing user credentials.

This module is essential for teams building integrations, automating workflows, or extending Snapsec’s capabilities across environments.

</Frame>

Each workspace is issued a **Public API Key** that can be used to authenticate requests.

### Key Capabilities
- **Secure Authentication** — Verifies the identity of calling applications.
- **Easy Access** — Copy or regenerate the key directly from the UI.
- **Controlled Exposure** — Designed for programmatic use without sharing user credentials.

The API key acts as a gateway for all supported Snapsec integrations.

API keys unlock multiple integration and automation use cases:

### Connect Adapters
Link adapters across applications to enable seamless data exchange between Snapsec modules and external tools.

### Access Secure Routes
Authenticate requests to protected APIs, ensuring only authorized services can access sensitive endpoints.

### Automate Integrations
Trigger events, sync data, and orchestrate workflows across connected systems without manual intervention.

### Monitor Usage
Track API activity, request frequency, and integration performance to maintain visibility and security.
