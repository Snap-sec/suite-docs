## Overview

Scanner Configuration provides a unified control panel to:

- Add and manage scanners  
- Modify detection settings  
- Configure scan thresholds and performance limits  
- Enable or disable scanning engines  
- Customize rulesets for different asset types  
- Monitor scanner health and last activity logs  

This gives teams complete flexibility over how and when scanning occurs.

## Scanner List & Status

<Frame caption="Connected Scanners">
  <img src="/images/vs/scanner-list.png" />
</Frame>

Each scanner entry includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Scanner Name** | Unique identifier for the scanner engine |
| **Type** | API, Web, Network, Cloud, or Custom Scanner |
| **Status** | Active, Idle, or Offline |
| **Last Seen** | Timestamp of last communication |
| **Version** | Scanner runtime or engine version |
| **Actions** | Edit, Disable, or Remove the scanner |

You can quickly detect inactive scanners or outdated engines from this view.

## Rule & Detection Settings

Each scanner can be customized to detect different vulnerability classes.

<Frame caption="Rule Management">
  <img src="/images/vs/scanner-rules.png" />
</Frame>

### Configurable Parameters Include:

- **OWASP Coverage**  
- **Scanner Depth / Crawl Limit**
- **Rate Limits**
- **Timeout Settings**
- **Excluded Paths or Endpoints**
- **Risk Threshold Filters**
- **Signature Packs & Behavioral Detection**

These options allow deep tailoring of scan sensitivity and performance.

---

## Performance & Rate Control

You can adjust scanning speed and load impact:

- **Concurrency level**
- **Request per second (RPS) caps**
- **Network throttling**
- **Max threads or parallel jobs**

This ensures scans do not overwhelm production systems.

---

## Health Monitoring

Each scanner reports:

- Uptime  
- Last heartbeat  
- Running jobs  
- Error logs  
- Version mismatches  
- Queued scans

## Best Practices

- Keep scanners updated to the latest engine version.  
- Disable unused scanners to reduce noise and errors.  
- Use environment-based scanners (e.g., staging-only) to reduce production load.  
- Configure rule packs based on business risk and application type.  
- Monitor scanner health regularly to prevent scanning gaps.
