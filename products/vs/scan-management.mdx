The **Scan Management** module centralizes all scanning operations — enabling teams to launch on-demand scans, manage recurring schedules, organize scans into groups, and monitor execution results in real time.
It acts as the operational hub for continuous vulnerability assessment.

## Overview

Scan Management provides full lifecycle control over every scan performed by Snapsec’s Vulnerability Scanner.  
From this module, you can:

- Launch manual or automated scans  
- Group related scans for organized workflows  
- Schedule recurring weekly or monthly scans  
- Track scan progress and completion  
- Review historical executions and statuses  

This ensures consistent and repeatable vulnerability coverage across all assets.

Each scan entry provides important metadata for operational clarity:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scan Name** | Title assigned to the scan |
| **Assets** | Number of assets included in the scan |
| **Scanner** | Scanner engine used (API, Web, Network, etc.) |
| **Created On** | Timestamp when the scan was created |
| **Last Executed** | Last time the scan was run |
| **Runs** | Total number of executions |
| **Actions** | Options to Run, Edit, or Delete |

A powerful scheduler allows you to automate scan cycles:

### Supported Frequencies
- **Daily**
- **Weekly**
- **Monthly**
- **Custom intervals**

Scheduling scans ensures continuous security checks without manual intervention.

## Scan Runs (Execution History)

<Frame caption="Scan Runs Overview">

</Frame>

The **Scan Runs** tab shows execution history for each scan, including:

- Execution status (Success, Failed, In Progress)
- Total vulnerabilities found
- Severity distribution
- Duration & timestamps
- Linked assets and scanner types

This timeline helps analysts track improvement or regression across repeated assessments.
