The **Vulnerability Catalogue** provides a unified, searchable list of all vulnerabilities detected by Snapsec's scanners.  
It helps analysts triage issues efficiently using severity filters, scanner context, asset metadata, and remediation insights.

## Overview

The Vulnerability Catalogue consolidates findings from:
- Scheduled scans  
- On-demand scans  
- CI/CD-triggered scans  
- External scanning adapters  

Each entry includes severity, affected asset, scanner source, timestamps, and remediation-state tracking.

This acts as your **primary workspace** for triage and vulnerability investigation.
