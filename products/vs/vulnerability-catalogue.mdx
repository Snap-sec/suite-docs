Each row in the table includes:

- **Title** — Name of the issue (e.g., *HTTP Missing Security Headers*)  
- **URL/Asset** — The affected endpoint or host  
- **State** — Vulnerability workflow state (e.g., *Open*, *In Review*)  
- **Scanner** — Source scanner (e.g., *Default Scanner*)  
- **Severity** — Severity label (Info in current sample)  
- **Reported On** — Detection timestamp (e.g., “5 hours ago”, “2 days ago”)  
- **Send to VM** — Option to create a ticket in Vulnerability Management  
- **Actions** — Ability to **suppress** a finding

## Filters & Search

Users can refine results using:

- **Search bar** — Search by title or URL  
- **Severity filter** — Show Info, Low, Medium, High, Critical  
- **Scanner filter** — View findings from specific scanners  
- **State filter** — Open, In Review, etc.
