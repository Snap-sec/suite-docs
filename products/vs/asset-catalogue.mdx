The **Asset Catalogue** provides a unified list of all assets monitored by the Vulnerability Scanner.  
It shows their exposure, vulnerability counts, scanning status, and risk posture — helping teams prioritize what matters most.

## Overview

The Asset Catalogue aggregates all assets discovered or imported into the Vulnerability Scanner.  
Each entry includes:

- Asset value (domain, IP, URL, or application)  
- Vulnerability count  
- Last scan status  
- Exposure level  
- Associated scanner  
- Automated risk score  

This centralized view helps identify unscanned assets, high-risk systems, or resources repeatedly flagged in tests.

## Search, Filters & Sorting

The catalogue includes powerful filtering for fast investigation.

### Available Filters

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Scanner** | Filter assets by the scanner that detected them. |
| **Exposure** | Identify exposed, internal, shadow, or unverified assets. |
| **Risk Score** | Sort by automated risk evaluation. |
| **hasVulns** | Show only assets with active vulnerabilities. |
| **Date Range** | Filter by detection or last scanned timeline. |

These filters allow analysts to focus on urgent or high-risk targets efficiently.

## Asset Table Columns

Each asset includes detailed metadata:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | URL, domain, or IP representing the scanned target |
| **Scanner** | The scanner engine used to test the asset |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of vulnerabilities detected |
| **Exposure** | Whether the asset is external, internal, or unknown |
| **Auto Risk** | System-generated risk score |
| **Last Scan** | Timestamp of the most recent scan |
| **Tags** | Labels for categorization and governance |
| **Detected On** | First time the asset was discovered |

## Asset Detail View

<Frame caption="Asset Detail View">
  <img src="/images/vs/products/asset-details.png" />
</Frame>

Each asset includes a full detail page showing:

- Summary information  
- Vulnerability list  
- Scan history  
- Technologies detected  
- Exposure reasoning  
- Risk insights  
- Evidence linkage  

This allows deep investigation of a specific system.

## How Assets Are Discovered

Assets may be added to the catalogue through:

- Manual submission during scan creation  
- CI/CD pipelines  
- Scheduled scans  
- Integrations with ASM, VM, or AIM  
- API-based imports  

The catalogue automatically updates as new assets appear in your environment.
