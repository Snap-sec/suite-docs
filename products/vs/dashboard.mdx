## Overview

The Dashboard consolidates insights from all scan engines and displays the current state of:

- Total vulnerabilities detected
- Severity-level distribution
- Total scans performed
- Active scanners
- Asset coverage

It highlights both long-term trends and moment-to-moment changes in your vulnerability landscape.
