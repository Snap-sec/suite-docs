Snapsec’s **Vulnerability Scanner Integrations** allow you to enrich scanning coverage, import external findings, automate CI/CD workflows, and centralize results from third-party tools — all into one unified vulnerability pipeline.

## Overview

Integrations expand the capability of the Vulnerability Scanner by enabling:

- **Import of scan results** from external scanners  
- **Triggering scans via CI/CD** systems  
- **Pulling asset inventories** from external platforms  
- **Syncing vulnerability metadata** between systems  
- **Automated enrichment** using threat and technology intelligence  

This ensures a single source of truth for all vulnerabilities detected across your ecosystem.

## CI/CD Integrations

### Supported Workflows
- GitHub Actions  
- GitLab CI  
- Jenkins  
- Bitbucket Pipelines  
- Custom webhook-based pipelines  

### Capabilities
- Trigger API, host, or web scans on deployment  
- Fail builds if severity thresholds are exceeded  
- Upload scan data back into VS automatically  

<Check>Ideal for DevSecOps teams enforcing shift-left security.</Check>

## External Scanner Integrations

### Examples Supported
- **Nuclei** (YAML-based scanning)  
- **Trivy** (Container & IaC scanning)  
- **ZAP / Burp** via exports  
- **OpenVAS** or custom scanner outputs  

### What Gets Imported
- Severity  
- Description & metadata  
- Affected assets  
- Timestamps  
- Evidence (if provided)  

This enables centralized triage inside Snapsec VM and VS.

---

## Asset Integrations

VS can pull assets from:
- Snapsec ASM  
- Cloud adapters (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Networking systems  
- Repositories (URLs, targets, APIs)  

This ensures the scanner always has a complete inventory for coverage.

## Integration Management

### Add an Integration
1. Go to **Integrations → Add New Integration**  
2. Select provider  
3. Configure credentials / keys  
4. Test connection  
5. Save  

### Monitor Integration Health
The integrator dashboard shows:
- Connection status  
- Last sync  
- Assets imported  
- Errors or misconfigurations  

Always maintain green-state for uninterrupted scanning.
