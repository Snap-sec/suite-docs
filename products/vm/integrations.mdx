## Overview

Integrations act as the bridge between Snapsec VM and your existing security or DevOps ecosystem.  
You can **import vulnerabilities**, **sync asset data**, or **push findings to external systems** like Jira or Qualys â€” ensuring your vulnerability management process remains seamless and automated.

All integrations are managed through lightweight, configurable **Adapters**, which define how data flows between Snapsec and connected platforms.

---

## Integration Types

Snapsec classifies integrations into two primary types â€” designed to make the flow of data simple and consistent:

### ðŸ”¹ Data Ingestion Integrations
These are sources that bring vulnerabilities, assets, or scan data **into Snapsec** from external systems.  
Examples: **Qualys**, **Nuclei**, **Trivy**, **AIM**, or manual CSV uploads.

Data Ingestion Integrations ensure your VM always has the latest vulnerability data from scanners and continuous monitoring sources.

### ðŸ”¹ Data Synchronization Integrations
These push vulnerability and remediation data **out of Snapsec** into third-party tools.  
Example: **Jira**, **ServiceNow**, or any custom webhook.

These integrations enable seamless collaboration between security and development teams â€” ensuring that findings automatically create or update tickets in your existing workflow.

## What Are Adapters?

Adapters are modular connectors that define how data is **fetched, transformed, and synced** between Snapsec and an external solution.

Each adapter handles:
- Authentication and connection setup  
- Data mapping (vulnerabilities, assets, owners, states)  
- Automated sync cycles (default: every **24 hours**)  

Adapters are flexible, meaning Snapsec can support **any commercial or open-source solution** with minimal setup.

## Supported Adapters

Snapsec currently supports the following built-in adapters, with support for more being added continuously:

| Adapter | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Jira** | Sync | Send vulnerability tickets for remediation tracking. |
| **Qualys** | Ingest | Import vulnerabilities from Qualys scans. |
| **AIM** | Ingest | Auto-import discovered assets from Snapsecâ€™s Asset Intelligence module. |
| **Nuclei** | Ingest | Fetch Nuclei scan results directly into assessments. |
| **Trivy** | Ingest | Import container and image scan vulnerabilities. |
| **CSV Import** | Ingest | Manually import vulnerability lists via CSV uploads. |
| **Manual Import** | Ingest | Add findings manually when API imports arenâ€™t available. |

## Connecting an Adapter

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integrations Page">
    Navigate to **Integrations** from the sidebar in Vulnerability Management.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an Adapter">
    Choose the integration (e.g., Qualys, Jira, Trivy) you want to configure and click **Install**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Connection Details">
    Enter the necessary fields â€” API key, credentials, endpoint URLs, or assessment mapping.  
    Each integration may have specific requirements.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Integrate">
    Once verified, Snapsec establishes a secure connection and fetches data immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Refreshing Adapters

All adapters refresh automatically every **24 hours**, ensuring data stays current with your latest scan results or ticket updates.  
You can also manually trigger a refresh anytime using the **Refresh** button beside the integration card.

<Callout icon="refresh-ccw" color="blue">
Manual refresh is ideal when youâ€™ve just run a new scan or closed issues in your external system and want Snapsec to update instantly.
</Callout>

## Why Integrate?

Integrations unify your **AppSec** and **DevSecOps** workflows â€” helping you:

- Avoid duplicate work by syncing vulnerability data automatically  
- Keep vulnerability states consistent across tools  
- Enable automatic ticket creation and closure  
- Centralize your reporting and risk visibility
