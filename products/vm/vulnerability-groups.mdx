## Overview

**Vulnerability Groups** enable you to organize vulnerabilities from multiple assets, assessments, and sources into logical collections — such as all *Access Control* issues or *API-related* vulnerabilities.  
This helps teams prioritize fixes, track themes, and export consolidated reports with ease.

Groups can be defined by vulnerability types, impacted components, responsible teams, or business context. They act as dynamic workspaces to simplify remediation management across large vulnerability datasets.

---

## Use Cases

- Group all *Access Control* or *Authentication* issues across multiple systems.  
- Maintain separate vulnerability lists per *team* or *department*.  
- Create category-based views (e.g., *API Vulnerabilities*, *Web XSS Issues*, *Encryption Weaknesses*).  
- Generate consolidated reports for specific vulnerability families.

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Vulnerability Groups">
    Navigate to **Vulnerability Management → Vulnerabilities → Groups**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click ‘Create Group’">
    Provide a **name** (e.g., “XSS” or “API Vulnerabilities”) and an optional **description** to help categorize the group.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Group">
    Once saved, your new group will appear in the list, ready to be populated with vulnerabilities.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Updating a Group">
    To rename or edit a group’s description, click the **three-dot menu (⋯)** on the card and select **Edit**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Manage Group">
    Open the group’s **Manage** option from the menu.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Vulnerabilities">
    Search across all vulnerabilities and select the ones you wish to add to the group.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove Vulnerabilities">
    To remove, deselect items or use the **Remove** button in the group management view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-Sync Option (optional)">
    Groups can be configured to automatically include vulnerabilities matching filters like CWE, severity, or keywords.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Group Data
<Frame caption="Vulnerability Groups — Manage categorized lists of vulnerabilities">

</Frame>

You can export grouped vulnerabilities either as a **CSV file** for analysis or as a **PDF report** for sharing and documentation.

### Export CSV
<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Group Menu">
    Click the three-dot (⋯) menu beside your chosen group.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select ‘Export CSV’">
    A CSV file will be generated containing all vulnerabilities, including metadata such as title, severity, CVSS, asset, and owner.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Export PDF Report

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select ‘Export PDF’">
    Generate a detailed **Consolidated Vulnerability Report** with full details, affected assets, CVSS scores, and remediation steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download the Report">
    The report will automatically compile and download, formatted for executive or audit-ready reviews.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

- Create functional groups (e.g., *API Issues*, *Auth Flaws*) to align with engineering teams.  
- Use CSV exports for bulk remediation tracking in external tools.  
- Use PDF exports for client reporting or audit documentation.  
- Review and refresh groups regularly to ensure updated vulnerability context.
