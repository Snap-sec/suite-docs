## Overview

**Blockers** allow teams to raise and track items that temporarily halt progress on vulnerability remediation or reporting.  
When something prevents a vulnerability from being closed — such as pending business approval, environment dependencies, or severity disagreements — a **blocker** provides visibility, accountability, and resolution tracking.

Each blocker is tied to a vulnerability, includes assigned members, and syncs activity between the **Vulnerability Report** and the **Blockers** dashboard.

## Creating a Blocker

Blockers are created directly within a vulnerability report when progress is stalled.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Vulnerability Report">
    Navigate to any vulnerability report where remediation is being tracked.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll to the Comment & Blocker Panel">
    Use the comment box to mention teammates and select the **‘Create a Blocker’** checkbox.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Blocker Details">
    Provide a **Title**, assign a responsible **User**, and describe the issue causing the delay.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Blocker">
    Click **Create Blocker** to record and notify the assigned user.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Blockers

All active and resolved blockers are available under the **Blockers** tab in the VM navigation.  
From here, you can track blockers by status, assignee, and related vulnerabilities.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View All Blockers">
    Open the **Blockers** page to see every blocker currently active across the organization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Mark Resolved">
    Once the issue is addressed (e.g., approval granted or fix verified), click **Mark Resolved** to close the blocker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reopen Blocker">
    If an issue reoccurs, click **Reopen Blocker** — this restores visibility in reports and dashboards.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Activity Timeline

Each blocker’s creation, resolution, and comments appear in the **Recent Activity** timeline within its associated vulnerability.  
This ensures full traceability of decision-making, discussions, and timeline accountability between security and development teams.

<Banner color="blue">
All blocker events — creation, resolution, or reopening — are automatically logged for audit and reporting.
