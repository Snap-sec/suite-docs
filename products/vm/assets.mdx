## Overview

The **Assets** page consolidates every application, subdomain, IP, or certificate discovered across your environment.  
It provides instant visibility into your attack surface with clear indicators for asset type, risk score, and remediation status.  
Each asset dynamically correlates with vulnerabilities detected across your scans and assessments — helping teams prioritize what to fix first.

Clicking any asset takes you directly to its **Vulnerability List**, showing all related findings, states, and remediation details.

## Filters

Use filters at the top of the table to refine your asset view quickly.  
You can filter assets by:

- **Type** (Application, Subdomain, IP, Certificate, Port)  
- **Owner** or assigned team  
- **Has Vulnerabilities** toggle to view only affected assets  
- **Risk score or remediation progress**

## How Assets Are Collected

Snapsec automatically aggregates asset data through **Adapters** — connectors that integrate directly with your discovery and security tools.  
Adapters continuously import and normalize data from:

- External discovery scanners (ASM integrations)  
- Cloud inventories and DNS records  
- Continuous monitoring feeds from your **AIM (Asset Intelligence Management)** module  

This unified asset catalog ensures your VM dashboard always reflects the latest and most accurate data.

Adapters synchronize asset ownership, metadata, and discovery sources automatically — eliminating manual imports.

## Vulnerability Data Correlation

Every asset is continuously correlated with vulnerabilities identified across your **assessments** and **integrations**.  
The system links each vulnerability to its originating asset and recalculates the **asset’s risk score** in real time.  

This provides a complete picture of which assets pose the highest exposure and need urgent attention.

## Auto Risk Updates

When new vulnerabilities are detected, or existing ones are resolved, the **Asset Risk Score** updates automatically.  
This dynamic scoring ensures your dashboard always reflects the latest state of risk across your environment — no manual recalculation required.

## Remediation Progress

Each asset includes a **Remediation Progress Bar** showing the percentage of resolved vs. open vulnerabilities.  
This metric allows teams to track closure rates and measure the impact of their ongoing fixes.
