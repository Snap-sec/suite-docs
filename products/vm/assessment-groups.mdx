## Overview

**Assessment Groups** allow you to organize related security assessments into structured folders.  
Whether you’re managing multiple VAPT cycles, infrastructure reviews, or code audits, grouping helps maintain clarity, reduce clutter, and enable quicker navigation across large projects.

Each folder acts as a logical workspace where you can add, rename, or delete subfolders and link specific assessments — making it easier for teams to track testing efforts by domain, environment, or client.

## Inside a Group

</Frame>

Within each group, you can:
- View and manage all related assessments in one place.  
- Create nested folders for sub-categories (e.g., *External*, *Internal*, *Cloud*).  
- Add or remove assessments as needed.

## Value

Assessment Groups bring **structure, scalability, and simplicity** to your vulnerability management workflow.  
They enable large organizations to manage hundreds of assessments efficiently — by client, project phase, or business unit — without losing traceability.
