## Overview

The **Reports** page centralizes all report generation and management within Vulnerability Management.  
From technical vulnerability exports to high-level executive summaries, this module allows you to create customized PDF reports tailored to your audience — from engineers to leadership.

Each report is automatically linked to its source assessment, asset, or change request for full traceability.  
You can generate, download, revalidate, or delete reports directly from this interface.

## Report Types & Their Purpose

Snapsec supports multiple report types designed for different stakeholders, decision points, and security workflows.  
Each report serves a distinct objective — from technical remediation to executive risk communication.

---

### Assessment Specific Reports

**Purpose:**  
Assessment-specific reports provide a **deep technical snapshot** of security findings for a single engagement, scan, or test.

They are primarily used to:
- Communicate detailed findings to engineering and security teams  
- Serve as an official deliverable for penetration tests or security assessments  
- Support remediation planning with evidence, impact, and reproduction steps  

These reports focus on **accuracy, depth, and exploit context**, making them ideal for hands-on remediation work.

---

### Asset Specific Reports

**Purpose:**  
Asset-specific reports concentrate on the **security posture of a single asset or asset group**, independent of how many assessments contributed to the findings.

They help teams:
- Understand long-term risk exposure of critical assets  
- Track recurring vulnerabilities across multiple scans  
- Support asset owners with focused remediation accountability  

These reports are commonly used for **asset owners, infrastructure teams, and cloud security reviews**.

---

### Executive Reports

**Purpose:**  
Executive reports translate technical vulnerability data into **business-level risk insights**.

They are designed to:
- Communicate security posture to leadership and non-technical stakeholders  
- Highlight trends, risk concentration, and remediation progress  
- Support board discussions, audits, and strategic planning  

Rather than listing every vulnerability, executive reports emphasize **impact, risk trends, and overall security maturity**.

---

### Change Request Reports

**Purpose:**  
Change request reports validate the **security impact of system changes** such as deployments, configuration updates, or infrastructure modifications.

They are used to:
- Ensure changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities  
- Provide security sign-off for release approvals  
- Maintain traceability between change management and security testing  

These reports are especially valuable in **DevSecOps and regulated environments** where change verification is mandatory.

---

### Revalidation Reports

**Purpose:**  
Revalidation reports confirm whether previously identified vulnerabilities have been **successfully fixed**.

They help teams:
- Verify remediation effectiveness  
- Prevent false closure of vulnerabilities  
- Provide audit-ready proof of fixes  

Revalidation reports are often used during **post-remediation reviews, compliance audits, and customer validation cycles**.
