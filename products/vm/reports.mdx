## Overview

The **Reports** page centralizes all report generation and management within Vulnerability Management.  
From technical vulnerability exports to high-level executive summaries, this module allows you to create customized PDF reports tailored to your audience — from engineers to leadership.

Each report is automatically linked to its source assessment, asset, or change request for full traceability.  
You can generate, download, revalidate, or delete reports directly from this interface.
