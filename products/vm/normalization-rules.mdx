## Normalization Rules Overview

The **Normalization Rules** dashboard provides a centralized view of all active and inactive rules used to normalize vulnerability severity and CVSS scores across the platform.

These rules allow security teams to standardize risk classification based on internal policies, asset context, or vulnerability type — ensuring consistent prioritization regardless of scanner source.

From this view, teams can:
- View all normalization rules and their status  
- Enable or disable rules instantly  
- See applied actions (e.g., severity changes)  
- Track rule creation and modification timestamps

## Create Normalization Rule

Creating a normalization rule starts with defining **basic rule metadata** and **conditions** that determine when the rule should apply.

</Frame>

### Rule Configuration Includes
- **Rule Name** — Human-readable identifier  
- **Description** — Purpose of the rule  
- **Conditions** — Match logic based on vulnerability fields  
  - Field  
  - Operator  
  - Value  

Multiple conditions can be combined to build precise normalization logic.

## Rule Actions – Set Discrete Severity

The **Actions** section defines what happens when conditions are met.  
One option is **Set Discrete Severity**, which overrides the vulnerability’s severity with a fixed value.

### Supported Severity Levels
- Critical  
- High  
- Medium  
- Low  
- Info  
- None  

This is commonly used to:
- Downgrade noisy findings  
- Elevate high-impact vulnerability classes  
- Align severity with internal risk policies

## Rule Actions – Transform CVSS Score

For more granular control, rules can **transform the CVSS score** using mathematical operations instead of fixed severity overrides.

</Frame>

### CVSS Transformation Options
- Select a mathematical operation  
- Apply a value (e.g., `+1.5`, `×0.8`, `−2`)  
- Automatically recalculate final severity based on the new CVSS score  

This approach enables:
- Risk tuning based on asset sensitivity  
- Context-aware scoring  
- Fine-grained prioritization without losing CVSS fidelity  

---

## Execute Normalization

The **Execute Normalization** action allows teams to immediately apply all active normalization rules across existing vulnerability data.

This is useful when:
- New rules are added  
- Severity logic is updated  
- Historical vulnerabilities need reclassification

Once confirmed, the system recalculates severity and CVSS values according to defined rules — without rescanning assets.

## Why Normalization Matters

Normalization rules ensure that vulnerability risk scoring reflects **your organization’s reality**, not just scanner defaults.

They help teams:
- Reduce alert fatigue  
- Maintain consistent severity standards  
- Align technical findings with business risk  
- Improve remediation prioritization
