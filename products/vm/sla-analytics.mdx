## Overview

The **SLA Analytics Dashboard** helps organizations measure how efficiently vulnerabilities are being remediated according to defined **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**.  
It tracks every vulnerability ticket’s progress, breach status, and compliance percentage across users, teams, and severity levels — ensuring that **no SLA breach goes unnoticed**.

---

## Value

SLA Analytics empowers security and engineering leaders to:

- **Monitor remediation timelines** for every severity category.
- **Detect SLA breaches** early and prioritize critical fixes.
- **Measure team performance** and compliance across departments.
- **Generate executive-ready reports** for audit and governance.
- **Optimize resources** by focusing on teams or assets lagging behind.
