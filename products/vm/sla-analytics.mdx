## Overview

The **SLA Analytics Dashboard** helps organizations measure how efficiently vulnerabilities are being remediated according to defined **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**.  
It tracks every vulnerability ticket’s progress, breach status, and compliance percentage across users, teams, and severity levels — ensuring that **no SLA breach goes unnoticed**.

---

## Value

SLA Analytics empowers security and engineering leaders to:

- **Monitor remediation timelines** for every severity category.
- **Detect SLA breaches** early and prioritize critical fixes.
- **Measure team performance** and compliance across departments.
- **Generate executive-ready reports** for audit and governance.
- **Optimize resources** by focusing on teams or assets lagging behind.

    Set the number of days allowed for each severity level — Critical, High, Medium, and Low.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adjust Weekend Configuration">
    Include or exclude Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays in SLA calculations based on your work week.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Holiday Exceptions">
    Optionally, import your organization’s holiday calendar (iCal) to exclude those days from SLA timers.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">

Each row shows severity, breach date, time overdue, and the assigned owner.



### Features:
- Filter by **severity**, **owner**, or **team**.
- Track **time overdue** and **breach date** for each issue.
- Identify **critical delays** that impact compliance metrics.
- Assign or reassign owners directly to expedite resolution.
