## Overview

The **Centralized Vulnerability List** provides a single, comprehensive view of all vulnerabilities identified across your entire organization — from assessments, assets, and integrated scanners.  
It enables teams to track, prioritize, and manage vulnerabilities efficiently, all from one place.

With intelligent filters, real-time states, and ownership visibility, this unified view removes the need to navigate multiple reports or dashboards. Every vulnerability is synced automatically from assessments and integrations, ensuring complete and current visibility.

## Filtering and Search

<Frame caption="Advanced filtering options for vulnerabilities">
  <img src="/images/vm/vulnerabilities2.png" alt="Filtering toolbar with filters for severity, assessment, owner, state, and teams" />
</Frame>

Filters make it simple to pinpoint vulnerabilities of interest. You can filter and search using:

- **Severity** – Critical, High, Medium, Low  
- **Assessment** – Specific assessments or projects  
- **Owners** – Filter by assigned remediation owners  
- **State** – In review, In progress, Re-test, Resolved, etc.  
- **Teams** – View vulnerabilities assigned to particular departments  

The search bar supports keyword lookups across vulnerability titles, domains, and affected assets.

<Callout icon="search" color="blue">
Combine multiple filters for advanced queries — for example, *Critical vulnerabilities in Docker assessments assigned to Team A*.

## Vulnerability States

Each vulnerability moves through clear, trackable states — making it easy to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks in remediation:

| State | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **In Review** | Under review by analysts or awaiting validation. |
| **In Progress** | Actively being worked on by developers or engineers. |
| **Re-Test** | Undergoing validation after remediation. |
| **Resolved** | Verified as fixed and no longer exploitable. |
| **Unresolved** | Not yet addressed or awaiting confirmation. |
| **False Positive / Not Applicable** | Marked as invalid or irrelevant to the environment. |

## Sorting and Prioritization

Vulnerabilities can be sorted by **severity**, **state**, **owner**, or **date reported** — helping teams prioritize their response efficiently.  
You can also group by assessments or filter by remediation responsibility.

---

## Linking to Context

Each vulnerability record links directly to:
- **The originating assessment** (for traceability)  
- **Associated asset or endpoint** (for impact analysis)  
- **Evidence and remediation notes**  

This ensures every issue remains fully contextualized and actionable within your workflow.

---

## Vulnerability Details View

Clicking on any vulnerability from the **Vulnerability List** opens a detailed view that consolidates **context, discussion, metadata, and evidence** into a single page.

This view is designed to help security teams, developers, and auditors collaborate on remediation without switching screens.

The top section presents the **full vulnerability narrative**, written in a structured and readable format.

### Included Sections
- **Title** — Clear, standardized vulnerability name  
- **Description** — Explanation of the issue and why it exists  
- **Steps to Reproduce** — Actionable steps to validate the finding  
- **Impact** — Security and business consequences if left unresolved  

This section acts as the **primary reference** for developers and reviewers during remediation.

## Why This Matters

This unified vulnerability view ensures that every issue is:

- **Clearly explained** for developers  
- **Collaboratively discussed** by all stakeholders  
- **Fully contextualized** with severity and ownership  
- **Backed by evidence** for validation and audits
