## Overview

**Global Search** provides a unified way to search across your entire vulnerability management ecosystem —  
whether vulnerabilities come from **different scanners, assessments, or manual pentests**.

You can instantly locate vulnerabilities, assets, endpoints, CWE identifiers, or even specific text within reports.  
Global Search ensures you never lose visibility of any issue, regardless of its origin or assessment.
