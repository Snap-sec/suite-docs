## Overview

The **Change Management** module allows organizations to securely track and assess changes introduced to their applications, infrastructure, or APIs.  
It ensures that every new release or feature undergoes a controlled security review before production deployment.

Whether you are performing internal change reviews or managing external pentest requests, this module provides a unified process for **security validation, approval tracking, and evidence management**.

---

## Purpose

Every code deployment or configuration update can impact the security posture.  
Change Management in Snapsec VM formalizes this process by:

- Documenting change requests with relevant context (title, owner, timeline, dependencies).
- Running targeted assessments on new or modified components.
- Tracking vulnerabilities introduced or fixed through each release.
- Maintaining traceability between changes, vulnerabilities, and pentest results.

## Creating a Change Request

Creating a change request captures all necessary information for a release or update validation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Change Management → Change Requests">
    Click **Create New Request** to open the change submission form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Request Summary">
    Include priority level, title, requester details, contact information, and a concise summary of the change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Timeline">
    Specify the request date, report deadline, and expected go-live window.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Technical Details">
    Provide environment details, URLs, authentication credentials, and link any API documentation or files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit for Review">
    Click **Create Request** to trigger validation and assign reviewers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Frame caption="Change Request creation form capturing summary and technical details">
  <img src="/images/vm/cm3.png" alt="New change request creation form" />
</Frame>

---

## Viewing and Managing Change Requests

All existing requests are listed in the **Change Requests** tab, where you can view, search, and filter by state, priority, or update date.

Each request includes linked vulnerabilities, associated evidence, and live metrics showing open/closed issues, severity breakdowns, and trends.

</Frame>

## Adding Vulnerabilities to a Change Request

During or after validation, vulnerabilities identified are automatically linked to their associated **Change Request**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="From the Assessment">
    Select vulnerabilities discovered during the pentest and map them to the related change request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto Link via Integration">
    If connected with CI/CD or scanners, vulnerabilities are automatically assigned to their respective change ID.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Track Progress">
    Track each vulnerability’s lifecycle under the **Metrics** tab within the change request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

## Change Info

The **Change Info** section provides a complete overview of the change request and its technical context.  
It helps security teams understand *what is changing*, *who owns it*, and *how risky the change is* before testing begins.

<Frame caption="Change Request – Change Info">
  <img src="/images/vm/cm-change-info.png" />
</Frame>

### Included Information
- **Request Details** — Title, requester, contact, dates, and ticket ID  
- **Technical Information** — Tech stack, integrations, data sensitivity, production impact  
- **Pentest Requirements** — Priority, deadlines, go/no-go criteria  
- **Technical Access Details** — Environment, URLs, authentication method, credentials  
- **Change Summary** — Release notes and functional updates  

This section acts as the **single source of truth** for the change request.

---

## Settings

The **Settings** tab allows teams to configure how the assessment behaves and how results are managed.

<Frame caption="Change Request – Settings Overview">
  <img src="/images/vm/change-settings.png" />
</Frame>

### What You Can Configure
- Assessment metadata (name, date, category)
- Default ticket assignee
- Business unit and department mapping
- Collaborators and access
- Assessment type and lifecycle state

---

## Import CSV (Within Settings)

The **Import CSV** option allows bulk ingestion of vulnerabilities into the change request.

<Frame caption="Import Vulnerabilities via CSV">
  <img src="/images/vm/change-import-csv.png" />
</Frame>

### Why Use Import CSV
- Upload results from third-party scanners
- Migrate findings from legacy tools
- Speed up onboarding of large vulnerability sets
- Standardize vulnerability intake for change testing

Imported vulnerabilities immediately become part of the assessment workflow.

---

## Export CSV (Within Settings)

The **Export CSV** option enables teams to extract assessment data for offline analysis or compliance needs.

<Frame caption="Export Vulnerabilities to CSV">
  <img src="/images/vm/change-export-csv.png" />
</Frame>

### Common Use Cases
- Share findings with external teams
- Perform custom analytics
- Maintain audit records
- Backup assessment data

Exports include vulnerability details, severity, status, and ownership.

---

## Custom Report

The **Custom Report** section allows users to manually curate executive-ready or client-facing reports.

<Frame caption="Custom Report Editor">
  <img src="/images/vm/change-custom-report.png" />
</Frame>

### Custom Report Sections
- **Report Title**
- **Author & Reviewer**
- **Executive Summary**
- **Custom Scope**
- **Methodology**
- **Conclusion**
- **Action Plan**

This gives full control over narrative, formatting, and messaging beyond auto-generated reports.

---

## Activity

The **Activity** tab provides a chronological audit trail of all actions performed within the change request.

<Frame caption="Change Request Activity Timeline">
  <img src="/images/vm/change-activity.png" />
</Frame>

### Tracked Events
- Assessment type changes (Black / Grey / White box)
- Status updates (Started, Paused, Completed)
- Configuration changes
- User actions and timestamps

This ensures **accountability, traceability, and compliance visibility**.

---

## Docs & Evidences

The **Docs & Evidences** section is used to upload proof, screenshots, logs, and supporting files related to the assessment.

<Frame caption="Upload Evidence Modal">
  <img src="/images/vm/change-docs-evidence.png" />
</Frame>

### Evidence Management
- Upload up to **20 files per upload**
- Max **10 MB per file**
- Store screenshots, logs, videos, or PDFs
- Maintain evidence for audits and revalidation

This section is critical for **compliance, verification, and reporting accuracy**.

---

## Why This Matters

Modern security failures often originate from *well-intentioned changes* — rushed releases, undocumented fixes, or unreviewed configuration updates.  
The **Change Management** module ensures that security is not an afterthought, but an embedded control point in every release cycle.

By combining request context, technical validation, vulnerability tracking, reporting, and evidence collection into a single workflow, Snapsec enables teams to:

- **Prevent risky changes from reaching production** without proper security validation  
- **Maintain continuous visibility** into how each change impacts risk posture  
- **Create defensible audit trails** linking changes, findings, approvals, and evidence  
- **Align engineering velocity with security governance**, not slow it down  
- **Support compliance requirements** with structured data instead of manual documentation  

Instead of fragmented tools and ad-hoc approvals, Change Management provides a **repeatable, traceable, and security-first release process** — helping organizations ship faster *without* compromising trust, compliance, or resilience.
