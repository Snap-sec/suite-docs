## Overview

The **Change Management** module allows organizations to securely track and assess changes introduced to their applications, infrastructure, or APIs.  
It ensures that every new release or feature undergoes a controlled security review before production deployment.

Whether you are performing internal change reviews or managing external pentest requests, this module provides a unified process for **security validation, approval tracking, and evidence management**.

---

## Purpose

Every code deployment or configuration update can impact the security posture.  
Change Management in Snapsec VM formalizes this process by:

- Documenting change requests with relevant context (title, owner, timeline, dependencies).
- Running targeted assessments on new or modified components.
- Tracking vulnerabilities introduced or fixed through each release.
- Maintaining traceability between changes, vulnerabilities, and pentest results.

### Dashboard Highlights

- **Requests by Status** — Track running, paused, completed, or pending requests.  
- **Recent Activities** — See recent submissions, updates, and completions.  
- **Vulnerability Overview** — Visualize vulnerabilities associated with each change request, categorized by severity.  
- **Top Priority Requests** — Quickly identify ongoing or urgent security validations.

## Creating a Change Request

Creating a change request captures all necessary information for a release or update validation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Change Management → Change Requests">
    Click **Create New Request** to open the change submission form.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Request Summary">
    Include priority level, title, requester details, contact information, and a concise summary of the change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Timeline">
    Specify the request date, report deadline, and expected go-live window.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Technical Details">
    Provide environment details, URLs, authentication credentials, and link any API documentation or files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit for Review">
    Click **Create Request** to trigger validation and assign reviewers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing and Managing Change Requests

All existing requests are listed in the **Change Requests** tab, where you can view, search, and filter by state, priority, or update date.

Each request includes linked vulnerabilities, associated evidence, and live metrics showing open/closed issues, severity breakdowns, and trends.

## Adding Vulnerabilities to a Change Request

During or after validation, vulnerabilities identified are automatically linked to their associated **Change Request**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="From the Assessment">
    Select vulnerabilities discovered during the pentest and map them to the related change request.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto Link via Integration">
    If connected with CI/CD or scanners, vulnerabilities are automatically assigned to their respective change ID.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and Track Progress">
    Track each vulnerability’s lifecycle under the **Metrics** tab within the change request.
  </Step>
</Steps>
