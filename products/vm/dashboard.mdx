## Best Practices

1. **Daily Monitoring**: Check the dashboard daily for new critical vulnerabilities
2. **Priority Focus**: Address Critical (41) and High (20) severity vulnerabilities first
3. **Assessment Tracking**: Monitor assessment progress and completion rates
4. **Team Performance**: Use member performance metrics to optimize resource allocation
5. **Trend Analysis**: Use remediation graphs to identify patterns and improve processes
