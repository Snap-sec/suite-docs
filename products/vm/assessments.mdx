# Assessments

Assessments in Snapsec Suite are structured security evaluations that help you systematically identify, track, and remediate vulnerabilities across your organization's assets. Think of assessments as organized security projects that bring together assets, scanning tools, and team members to create a comprehensive security evaluation.

## What are Assessments?

Assessments are the core organizational unit in Snapsec Suite's Vulnerability Management module. They serve as containers that:

- **Group related assets** together for security evaluation
- **Track vulnerability discovery** and remediation progress
- **Assign ownership** and responsibility to team members
- **Organize security work** into manageable projects
- **Generate reports** and metrics for stakeholders

### How Assessments Work in Snapsec

1. **Create an Assessment**: Define the scope, timeline, and team
2. **Add Assets**: Include the systems, applications, or infrastructure to be evaluated
3. **Run Scans**: Execute vulnerability scans or manual testing
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor vulnerability discovery and remediation
5. **Generate Reports**: Create executive and technical reports

## Assessment Cards

Each assessment is displayed as a card on the assessments page, providing immediate visibility into key information:

### Card Information
- **Assessment Name**: Clear title identifying the security project
- **Date**: When the assessment was created or last modified
- **Status**: Current state (Not Configured, Paused, Completed)
- **Vulnerability Breakdown**: Count by severity (C=Critical, H=High, M=Medium, L=Low)
- **Owner**: Assigned team member (shown as initials)

### Example Assessment Cards

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
