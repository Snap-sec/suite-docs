## Overview

An **Assessment** aggregates everything for one security engagement — status, trends, ownership, evidence, and reporting.  
Use the top header to see **In Review/In Progress/Resolved**, duplicates, retests, staging fixes, members, and overall progress.  
Below, charts expose **Vulnerability Trends**, **Open/Close Severity Distribution**, **Severity mix**, and **Top 5 vulnerabilities** for quick triage.

## Assessment Metric

<Frame caption="Live charts for trends and distributions inside an assessment">
  <img src="/images/vm/ass2.png" alt="Charts for vulnerability trend over time, open vs close severity and severity donut" />
</Frame>

Assessment Metrics provides a real-time overview of an assessment’s progress and health.
It visualizes key data such as total vulnerabilities, remediation status, and severity distribution — helping teams quickly understand how many issues are open, resolved, or pending re-test.
The page’s purpose is to track remediation effectiveness, analyze vulnerability trends, and measure progress within a specific assessment, ensuring every test leads to measurable security improvement.



<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Status & Progress" icon="gauge">
    Snapshot of state chips and a progress bar (e.g., **Resolved 17 of 23**). Great for stand-ups and executive updates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Trends & Quality" icon="chart-line">
    Line/bar/donut charts show discovery vs. closure, open/close by severity, and overall severity distribution.
  </Card>

## Managing Assessments

The **Basic Details** tab allows you to edit key configuration details of your assessment and manage its overall lifecycle.  
You can update the assessment name, modify category or scope, assign ticket owners, and manage collaborators — keeping your engagement organized and up to date.

---

### Updating Name or Category

<Frame caption="Add or remove collaborators from the assessment">
  <img src="/images/vm/ass4.png" alt="Collaborators section showing team member management in the assessment panel" />
</Frame>

Edit the **Assessment Name**, **Date**, or **Category** fields directly from the form.  
These updates automatically sync across related dashboards, ensuring consistent labeling and visibility for reports, trends, and performance metrics.

<Callout icon="info-circle" color="blue">
Renaming an assessment does not affect linked vulnerabilities or reports — all associated data remains intact.
</Callout>

### Adding or Removing Collaborators


<Frame caption="Add or remove collaborators from the assessment">
  <img src="/images/vm/ass5.png" alt="Collaborators section showing team member management in the assessment panel" />
</Frame>

Use the **Collaborators** panel to invite or remove team members.  
Collaborators can view vulnerabilities, upload evidence, and contribute to custom reports — enabling shared visibility and accountability.

### Updating Assessment State

</Frame>

Control your assessment’s status through three lifecycle options:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Start Assessment" icon="play">
    Begin active testing. Findings and evidence tracking start automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pause Assessment" icon="pause">
    Temporarily stop testing while preserving current data and progress.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complete Assessment" icon="check-circle">
    Finalize your testing, generate reports, and mark the engagement as closed.
  </Card>
</Columns>

<Banner>
Keeping states updated ensures all team members — security, QA, and developers — stay synchronized on what’s currently being tested or finalized.

## CSV Import (optional)

<Frame caption="Import vulnerabilities from external scanners via CSV template">

</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Import">
    Click **Import CSV** from the Basic Details actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload file">
    Attach your scanner export (10MB max). Use our template headers to map title, summary, impact, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate & Import">
    Review the preview and confirm — findings are linked to this assessment automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Assessment Evidences

<Frame caption="Centralized repository for screenshots, logs, and proofs" >
  <img src="/images/vm/ass8.png" alt="Empty evidences state with upload button and illustration" />
</Frame>

- Upload screenshots, PoCs, logs, and recordings.  
- Tag evidence to **specific vulnerabilities** or keep it **assessment-level** for methodology and scope proofs.

## Custom Report tab

<Frame caption="Generate executive-ready reports from structured fields" >
  <img src="/images/vm/ass9.png" alt="Custom Report builder with fields for title, author, reviewers, executive summary, scope, methodology, conclusion" />
</Frame>

<Fields>
  <Field name="Report Title">Display name of the report document.</Field>
  <Field name="Author & Reviewer">Attribution and review trail for auditability.</Field>
  <Field name="Executive Summary">High-level outcomes and risk posture.</Field>
  <Field name="Custom Scope">Assets, endpoints, or exclusions for this engagement.</Field>
  <Field name="Methodology">Tools, techniques, and test approaches used.</Field>
  <Field name="Conclusion">Risk summary, next steps, and recommendations.</Field>
</Fields>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Export">
    Export to PDF/Doc as needed; the report stays linked to assessment evidence and findings.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Traceability">
    Each section references **real findings** and **evidence**, ensuring end-to-end audit trails.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Why this matters

- **Single source of truth:** metrics → configuration → evidence → report, all in one place.  
- **Speed with control:** import external scanner data, validate, and report without losing context.  
- **Audit-ready:** collaborators, access levels, and report fields provide clear governance.

## Next Steps
