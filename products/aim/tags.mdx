## Overview

Tags enable effortless organization and quick reference across your asset inventory.  
They help categorize assets by source, type, ownership, or environment â€” making it easier to track, filter, and act on related groups.  
Clicking any tag dynamically opens the **Global Catalog** filtered for that tag.

## Deep Link Format

```text
/products/aim/gloabl-catalog?tag={tagName}
```

> Examples:  
> `/products/aim/gloabl-catalog?tag=Cloudflare`  
> `/products/aim/gloabl-catalog?tag=SSL`  
> `/products/aim/gloabl-catalog?tag=Repository`

## Best Practices

- Use consistent prefixes like `env:`, `team:`, or `source:` for clean governance.  
- Pair source tags (e.g., `GitLab`, `Cloudflare`) with functional ones (`API`, `Repo`) for richer filtering.  
- Regularly review tags with high counts (`decommissioned`, `shadowed`) to track lifecycle maturity.
