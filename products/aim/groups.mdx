## Overview

Groups in **Asset Intelligence Management (AIM)** allow you to cluster similar assets together ‚Äî such as *DNS-active subdomains*, *Cloudflare-reported assets*, or *API endpoints*.  
This enables teams to manage related resources collectively, monitor them for changes, and apply consistent analysis or reporting.

Groups can be static (manually created) or dynamic (auto-populated based on tags and rules).

## Tips

- Use clear naming conventions (e.g., `Production APIs`, `Decommissioned IPs`, `Active DNS Hosts`).  
- Leverage **tags** to auto-populate dynamic groups.  
- Regularly review group membership to maintain clean inventory boundaries.  
- Share group-based links across modules like VM and ASM to maintain data consistency.
