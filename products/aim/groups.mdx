## Overview

Groups in **Asset Intelligence Management (AIM)** allow you to cluster similar assets together — such as *DNS-active subdomains*, *Cloudflare-reported assets*, or *API endpoints*.  
This enables teams to manage related resources collectively, monitor them for changes, and apply consistent analysis or reporting.

Groups can be static (manually created) or dynamic (auto-populated based on tags and rules).

## Creating a New Group

You can create a group by defining its name, selecting tags, and providing a clear description of what the group represents.

## Managing Groups

Each group card includes quick actions for:
- ✏️ **Edit** — Modify name, tags, or description  
- 🗑️ **Delete** — Permanently remove the group  
- 🔗 **Manage assets** — View or edit assets associated with the group

## Viewing Group Assets

Clicking on any group opens a filtered view in the **Global Catalog**, showing only assets belonging to that group.  
You can see complete details — source, vulnerabilities, owners, risk scores, and tags.

## Tips

- Use clear naming conventions (e.g., `Production APIs`, `Decommissioned IPs`, `Active DNS Hosts`).  
- Leverage **tags** to auto-populate dynamic groups.  
- Regularly review group membership to maintain clean inventory boundaries.  
- Share group-based links across modules like VM and ASM to maintain data consistency.
