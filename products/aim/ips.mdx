## Overview

The **IP Address Catalog** in AIM provides a centralized view of all live, internal, and external IPs across your organization.  
It helps teams monitor exposure status, analyze vulnerability severity, and map asset ownership — all from one interactive dashboard.

## Overview

The **IP Catalog** aggregates all network IPs discovered via integrated adapters, vulnerability management systems, or external scanners.  
It provides deep insights into risk, vulnerability severity, exposure classification, and network ownership.

Each IP record represents a monitored endpoint within your ecosystem — whether internal, external, or shadowed — and is automatically correlated with vulnerabilities, ASN, and organization data.

## Search, Filters, and Sorting

The IP catalog provides advanced filtering to help users narrow results and locate high-priority assets.

| Filter | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Owners** | Filter by the person or team responsible for the IP. |
| **Risk** | Filter or sort based on automated risk score. |
| **Exposure** | Show IPs classified as `Exposed`, `Not Exposed`, or `Shadowed`. |
| **Adapters** | Filter IPs discovered through specific integrations or scanners. |
| **hasVulns** | Show only IPs linked to vulnerabilities. |
| **Organisations** | Filter by organization name or ASN. |
| **Date Range** | Filter by detection timeline (First/Last Found). |

These filters can be combined for detailed analysis of network exposure and risk.

---

## IP Table Columns

Each IP entry displays detailed asset metadata for precise tracking.

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | The IP address and source details. |
| **Location** | Country, city, and geolocation information. |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of vulnerabilities tied to the IP. |
| **Exposure** | Current exposure status (`Exposed`, `Not Exposed`, or `Shadowed`). |
| **Auto Risk** | System-calculated risk score. |
| **Organisation / ASN** | The associated organization or network provider. |
| **Owner** | Assigned user or team responsible for this IP. |
| **Tags** | Classification tags like `VM`, `IP`, or `Internal`. |
| **Associations** | Connected assets or relationships within the inventory. |
| **Detected On** | Timestamp showing first and most recent detection. |

### IP Summary

At the top of the page, the summary card displays key asset identifiers:

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **IP Address** | The specific IP being analyzed. |
| **Status** | Indicates if the IP is active, inactive, or decommissioned. |
| **Total Vulnerabilities** | Number of open issues discovered. |
| **Risk Score** | Automatically generated score reflecting severity and exposure. |
| **Exposure** | Marks whether the IP is safe, exposed, or unknown. |
| **Environment** | Classified environment if detected (e.g., Internal, External). |
| **Managed By** | User or owner assigned to manage the asset. |
| **Detection Timeline** | “First Found” and “Last Found” dates for tracking changes. |

### Vulnerability Insights

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Vulnerability Trends" icon="chart-line">
  Displays how vulnerabilities have evolved over time for the specific IP.  
  Useful for tracking the impact of patch management and mitigation efforts.
</Card>

<Card title="Severity Distribution" icon="circle-exclamation">
  Shows vulnerability severity breakdown (Critical, High, Medium, Low) for quick prioritization.
</Card>

</Columns>

The **Vulnerability Table** below lists each vulnerability linked to this IP, with details such as:
- Title  
- Severity  
- State (Resolved / In Review)  
- Detection history  

Each entry can be cross-referenced directly within the VM module.

---

### Tags, Technologies, and Open Ports

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Tags" icon="tags">
  Tags categorize IPs based on business or technical context.  
  Examples include: `VM`, `IP`, `External`, `Internal`.
</Card>

<Card title="Technologies" icon="microchip">
  Displays any technologies identified from associated assets or scans (e.g., Apache, Nginx, SSH).
</Card>

</Columns>

#### Open Ports
Shows detected network ports, their protocol, and exposure state.  
Used to assess services running on the IP and identify potential risks.

---

### Location Details

The **Location Details** panel automatically enriches each IP with geolocation and organization intelligence, including:
- **Organisation & ASN**
- **Country, City, and Region**
- **Timezone & Postal Code**
- **Network Segment** (if internal classification applies)

These details enable quick attribution and mapping for distributed infrastructures.

---

### Asset Relations

<Frame caption="IP Asset Relations Graph">
  <img src="/images/aim/ip3.png" alt="IP Relations Graph in AIM" />
</Frame>

The **Asset Relation Graph** maps relationships between IPs, domains, and associated assets, enabling analysts to visualize network context and dependencies.

---

### Ownership & Lifecycle Management

Each IP asset includes full lifecycle controls:
- **Assign Owner** – set or change responsible person/team.  
- **Decommission Asset** – mark inactive or deprecated IPs.  
- **Delete Asset** – permanently remove invalid or duplicate entries.  

All updates synchronize across AIM and connected modules.

---

## How IPs Are Discovered

AIM detects and updates IP assets using various adapters and integrations:
- **VM Adapter** – imports IPs linked with vulnerabilities.  
- **ASM Adapter** – discovers live and shadow IPs from external scans.  
- **TechDetect Adapter** – identifies IP-level technologies and ports.  

These integrations keep the IP inventory up to date with real-time exposure and risk insights.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Network Security Teams:** Identify and prioritize vulnerable or exposed IPs.  
- **Asset Managers:** Maintain accurate internal vs. external IP segmentation.  
- **Incident Responders:** Investigate IPs involved in breaches or suspicious activities.  
- **Compliance Teams:** Audit all active IPs and verify that no shadow assets exist.
