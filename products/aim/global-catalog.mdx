The **Global Asset Catalog** is the central hub of AIM — providing unified visibility into every discovered, imported, or manually created asset.  
It brings together data from multiple adapters, allowing teams to search, filter, and manage their entire asset landscape in one place.

## Overview

The **Global Asset Catalog** acts as the master index for your organization's digital assets — combining insights from integrations, discovered inventories, and custom entries.  
From domains to certificates, each asset is enriched with risk scores, ownership data, and vulnerability context.

This page enables analysts, engineers, and security leads to easily navigate, search, and maintain accurate visibility into all active and decommissioned assets.

## Using the Global Asset Catalog

### 1. Searching Assets
The search bar supports advanced query syntax for precise filtering.  
You can combine filters such as:

  <img src="/images/aim/assets3.png" alt="Asset Filtering and Search in AIM" />
</Frame>



Supported filters include:
| Filter | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `domain:` | Filter by domain name (e.g., `domain:snapsec.co`) |
| `risk:` | Filter assets by calculated risk level |
| `exposure:` | Identify exposed or at-risk assets |
| `tech:` | Find assets by technology (e.g., `tech:react`) |
| `type:` | Filter by asset type (subdomain, repo, dns, etc.) |
| `owner:` | Find assets by assigned owner |
| `group:` | Filter assets by business or project grouping |
| `hasVulns:` | Identify assets linked with known vulnerabilities |
| `decommissioned:` | Show only decommissioned assets |

### 2. Creating and Importing Assets

You can manually create assets or bulk import them via CSV.

<Frame caption="Add New Asset Form">
  <img src="/images/aim/assets1.png" alt="Add New Asset in AIM" />
</Frame>

**Options:**
- Select asset type (e.g., Subdomain, API, IP, Application).  
- Define the asset name and value.  
- Upload a CSV file for bulk import.  
- Automatically validate and enrich data using connected adapters.

---

### 3. Reviewing Asset Health

Each asset entry includes:
- **Auto Risk Score** – automatically calculated using defined classifiers.  
- **Vulnerability Count** – number of linked vulnerabilities from VM.  
- **Source** – where the asset was discovered (e.g., SSL Cert, DNS, Adapter).  
- **Detection Timeline** – first and last discovery timestamps.  
- **Tags and Associations** – asset classification and linked components.

---

## Value for Teams

- Gain **complete visibility** into your organization’s attack surface.  
- **Search and filter instantly** across thousands of assets.  
- **Correlate assets** with vulnerabilities and risk posture.  
- **Simplify ownership mapping** and lifecycle tracking.  
- **Ensure inventory accuracy** through manual and automated synchronization.
