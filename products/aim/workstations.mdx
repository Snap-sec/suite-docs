## Workstation Dashboard Overview

The **Workstation Directory** provides a centralized dashboard of all employee-linked devices such as laptops, desktops, and virtual workstations discovered across the environment.

This dashboard gives security and IT teams immediate visibility into device posture, vulnerability presence, exposure status, and ownership.

### What the Dashboard Shows

- **Total Workstations** — All discovered employee devices
- **Vulnerable Workstations** — Devices with one or more security findings
- **Exposure Status** — Safe vs exposed workstations
- **Risk Distribution** — Risk scoring across devices
- **Vulnerability Trends** — High-level trend view (when data exists)
- **Severity Distribution** — Breakdown of Critical, High, Medium, and Low findings

Below the analytics, the workstation table allows teams to:

- Search devices by name or identifier  
- Filter by owner, risk, exposure, adapters, or vulnerability presence  
- Sort devices by risk score, discovery date, or vulnerability count  

Each row represents a single workstation asset tracked by AIM.

## Asset Risk Calculation

Each workstation includes a transparent and explainable **Asset Risk Calculation**, showing exactly how its final risk score is derived.

### How Risk Is Calculated

AIM computes workstation risk using weighted components:

- **Vulnerabilities (60%)**  
  Based on severity counts:
  - Critical
  - High
  - Medium
  - Low

- **Exposure (30%)**  
  Whether the workstation is externally reachable or safely contained.

- **Inherent Asset Risk (10%)**  
  Baseline risk associated with the asset type (workstation, laptop, VM).

### Final Risk Score

All components are combined into a **final numerical risk score**, giving teams:

- Clear prioritization
- Consistent scoring across asset types
- Defensible risk justification for audits and reporting

This ensures workstation risk is **measurable, explainable, and actionable**.

## Workstation Asset View (Inside a Workstation)

Clicking any workstation opens its **Workstation Asset View**, providing deep visibility into that specific device.

  <img src="/images/aim/workstation-asset-view.png" />
</Frame>

### Workstation Summary Panel

Each workstation asset displays:

- **Device Name & Status** (Active / Decommissioned)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure Status**
- **Environment** (Prod, Dev, Unknown)
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By** (Owner or team)

Lifecycle actions available:
- **Decommission Asset**
- **Delete Asset**

### Workstation Insights

Within the asset view, teams can access:

- **Vulnerability Trends** — Historical vulnerability changes
- **Severity Distribution** — Severity breakdown for findings
- **Tags** — Labels such as `workstation`, `laptop`, `employee-device`
- **Technologies** — Installed or detected technologies (if available)
- **Asset Relations Graph** — Visual mapping of relationships with:
  - Employees
  - Applications
  - Repositories
  - Certificates
  - Other infrastructure assets

This view enables precise investigation, faster remediation, and clear understanding of device impact across the organization.
