The **Workstation Directory** gives security and IT teams complete visibility into all employee-linked devices such as laptops, desktops, VMs, and spare systems.  
AIM continuously monitors workstation posture, vulnerabilities, ownership, and relationships with other assets.

---

## Workstation Dashboard

The dashboard provides a centralized view of all discovered workstations and their overall security posture.

<Frame caption="Workstation Dashboard Overview">
  <img src="/images/aim/workstations/workstations-dashboard.png" />
</Frame>

### What You See on the Dashboard

- **Total Workstations** discovered across the organization  
- **Vulnerable Workstations** with detected security issues  
- **Exposure Status** (Safe / Exposed / Shadowed)  
- **Risk Scoring** based on vulnerabilities and exposure  
- **Discovery Timeline** showing first and last detection  

### Risk & Severity Insights

<Frame caption="Workstation Vulnerability & Severity Distribution">
  <img src="/images/aim/workstations/workstations-severity.png" />
</Frame>

This view helps teams quickly identify:
- High-risk endpoints
- Devices requiring immediate patching
- Shadow or unmanaged workstations

### Asset Relationship Awareness

Workstations are not isolated assets. AIM visually maps their relationships to:
- Employees
- Applications
- Repositories
- Certificates
- Network services

This provides immediate context on **blast radius** if a workstation is compromised.

## Inside a Workstation Asset

Clicking a workstation opens its **full asset profile**, enabling deep inspection and lifecycle control.

</Frame>

### Asset Summary Panel

Each workstation asset includes:

- **Status** (Active, Shadowed, Decommissioned)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure State**
- **Environment** (Prod, Unknown, etc.)
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By** (Owner assignment)

### Vulnerability & Severity Analysis

<Frame caption="Workstation Vulnerability Trends">
  <img src="/images/aim/workstations/workstations-trends.png" />
</Frame>

- Tracks vulnerability trends over time  
- Shows severity distribution (Critical, High, Medium, Low)  
- Helps validate remediation progress  

### Tags, Technologies & Ports

Inside the asset, teams can manage:
- **Tags** (e.g., workstation, VM, spare-device)
- **Technologies** installed or detected
- **Open Ports** (if applicable)

This enables deeper technical profiling of each device.

### Asset Relationship Graph

<Frame caption="Workstation Asset Relations">
  <img src="/images/aim/workstations/workstations-relations.png" />
</Frame>

The relationship graph shows how a workstation connects to:
- Employees
- Applications
- Repositories
- Other infrastructure assets  

This is critical for impact analysis during incidents.

### Lifecycle Actions

Each workstation supports full lifecycle management:
- **Assign / Change Owner**
- **Decommission Workstation**
- **Delete Asset**

All changes sync across AIM modules in real time.
