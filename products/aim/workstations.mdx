## Overview

The **Workstation Directory** provides full visibility into all employee-linked devices, including laptops, virtual machines, and decommissioned workstations.  
AIM automatically aggregates workstation data from integrated adapters, correlates vulnerabilities, assigns risk scores, and tracks exposure over time.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **153 Workstations** | Total discovered devices in the environment. |
| **138 Vulnerable Workstations** | Devices associated with at least one vulnerability. |
| **15 Tested Workstations** | Systems assessed through active scanning integrations. |
| **153 Shadowed** | Unmanaged or unassigned workstations discovered via adapters. |

These metrics enable IT and security teams to quickly understand the scale, health, and risk posture of employee devices.

---

## Severity & Risk Distribution

AIM categorizes workstation risk using multiple factors including vulnerability counts, exposure state, and workstation classification.

</Frame>

This helps teams immediately identify high-risk devices that require patching or remediation.

## Search, Filters & Sorting

Powerful filters allow you to locate specific devices or isolate high-priority assets.

| Filter | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | Find devices tied to a specific employee. |
| **Risk** | Sort by system-generated workstation risk score. |
| **Exposure** | Identify exposed or decommissioned workstations. |
| **Adapters** | Filter based on data source (CSV, VM, directory sync, etc.). |
| **hasVulns** | Show devices with open vulnerabilities. |

Filters can be combined for precise investigation workflows.

## Workstation Table Fields

Each workstation entry includes complete metadata used for security, IT operations, and compliance.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | IP or identifier for the workstation. |
| **Source** | Origin of discovery (e.g., CSV import, VM scan). |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of vulnerabilities linked to the device. |
| **Auto Risk** | AIM-generated workstation risk score. |
| **Owner** | Associated employee or Unknown. |
| **Tags** | Labels such as `VM`, `workstation`, `decommissioned`. |
| **Associations** | Connected assets (e.g., repositories, certificates). |
| **Detected On** | First and most recent discovery timestamps. |

## Workstation Full View

Each workstation’s detail page offers a deep dive into risk and activity:

### Summary Includes
- Device status (active, shadowed, decommissioned)
- Vulnerability totals
- Exposure classification
- Risk score
- Owner or responsible team
- Detection timeline

### Additional Panels
- **Vulnerability history & severity charts**
- **Tags & metadata**
- **Associations with other assets**
- **Lifecycle actions (Assign Owner, Decommission, Delete)**

These insights allow teams to track workstation behavior and exposure trends over time.

---

## Lifecycle Management

AIM supports complete end-to-end workstation lifecycle operations:

- **Assign Owner** — link the workstation to an employee  
- **Decommission Device** — retire outdated or inactive systems  
- **Delete Asset** — remove invalid or duplicate entries  

All updates sync across AIM modules, enabling consistent asset management.

---

## How AIM Detects Workstations

Workstation data is collected automatically from:

- **Directory sync adapters** (employee device inventories)  
- **Vulnerability scanners**  
- **CSV imports**  
- **Network discovery tools**  

AIM continuously updates device metadata, risk scores, and exposure classifications.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Security Teams:** Identify vulnerable devices and prioritize remediation.  
- **IT Teams:** Track device ownership, lifecycle status, and activity.  
- **Compliance:** Ensure all employee devices are accounted for and monitored.  
- **Incident Response:** Investigate compromised or suspicious workstations rapidly.
