## Overview

The **Repositories Catalog** in AIM centralizes all Git repositories discovered through integrations such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or internal SCM systems.

It provides deep visibility into:

- Repository ownership  
- Risk levels  
- Activity patterns  
- Exposure risks  
- Linked assets and vulnerabilities  

AIM continuously syncs repository metadata, ensuring a **live, accurate, and enriched** inventory of your engineering ecosystem.

## Key Metrics and Analytics

- **Total Repositories**  
  Count of all repos detected and synced from integrations.

- **Private vs Public**  
  Distribution showing which repos are publicly visible, reducing shadow-exposure risks.

- **Inactive Repositories**  
  Repos with no commits or activity for long periods — a major source of security debt.

- **Risk Classification**  
  Repos enriched with auto-risk based on configurations, secrets, or linked vulnerabilities.

- **Top Owners & Teams**  
  Most active or responsible teams across repository inventory.

## Search, Filters, and Sorting

Search and filters enable teams to quickly find high-priority repositories.

**Filters available:**

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Owners** | Filter by repository owner, maintainer, or engineering team. |
| **Risk** | Sort or filter by AIM risk score. |
| **Visibility** | Public / Private / Internal repositories. |
| **Adapters** | Source integration (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.). |
| **hasVulns** | Filter repos linked to vulnerabilities or code issues. |
| **Date Range** | Filter by creation, last activity, or last sync. |
| **Tags** | Find repositories labeled with custom or automated tags. |

---

## Repository Table Columns

Each repository entry displays critical metadata:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Repository Name** | Name + link to SCM provider. |
| **Visibility** | Public / Private / Internal. |
| **Owner** | Assigned maintainer or team. |
| **Activity** | Last commit or update timestamp. |
| **Risk Score** | Auto-calculated based on metadata or exposures. |
| **Linked Assets** | Connections to APIs, services, domains, or IPs. |
| **Vuln Count** | Vulnerabilities associated with the repo. |
| **Tags** | Labels such as backend, frontend, sensitive, archived. |
| **Adapter** | Source platform for synchronization. |
| **Detected On** | First/last seen timestamps. |

---

## Repository Full View

Each repository includes a rich, detailed view:

### Repository Summary

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Repository Name** | Full name with SCM provider reference. |
| **Visibility** | Private, Public, or Internal. |
| **Owner / Maintainer** | Person or team responsible for the repository. |
| **Last Activity** | Last commit, push, or pull request. |
| **Risk Score** | AIM-generated risk value. |
| **Environment** | Production / Development / Sandbox classification (if detected). |
| **Detection Timeline** | First sync and last sync timestamps. |

## Risk & Exposure Insights

### **Risk Factors**
- Public exposure  
- Orphaned or unowned repositories  
- Weak or missing access policies  
- Secrets or credentials found via SCM integrations  
- Linked high-severity vulnerabilities  

### **Activity Breakdown**
Shows commit frequency, contributors, and activity trends over time.

### **Linked Vulnerabilities**
If integrated with VM or scanning tools, vulnerabilities appear here with:

- Severity  
- State  
- Detection history  
- Affected dependencies  

---

## Tags, Technologies & Linked Assets

### Tags
Custom or classifier-driven labels such as:  
**backend**, **frontend**, **internal**, **critical-service**, **archived**

### Technologies
Tech stack detected via linked deployments or metadata (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker).

### Asset Relations

</Frame>

The relation graph shows connections to:

- Services  
- APIs  
- Domain assets  
- Employee accounts  
- Infrastructure components  

---

## Ownership & Lifecycle Management

Each repository includes lifecycle controls such as:

- **Assign Owner**
- **Change Maintainer**
- **Tag Repository**
- **Decommission Repository**
- **Delete Repository**

All changes propagate across all AIM modules.

---

## How Repositories Are Discovered

AIM syncs repository data using:

- **GitHub Adapter**
- **GitLab Adapter**
- **Bitbucket Adapter**
- **Internal SCM integrations**
- **ASM & VM correlations** (e.g., vulnerabilities linked to repository paths)

This ensures continuous visibility into unmanaged or shadow repositories.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Engineering Managers:** Track repository ownership and inactive projects.  
- **DevSecOps Teams:** Identify public repos, secrets risk, and code weaknesses.  
- **Asset Managers:** Maintain accurate repository inventory across teams.  
- **Compliance:** Ensure all code repositories meet visibility and governance rules.
