## Overview

The **Repositories Catalog** provides complete visibility into all code repositories detected across your organization — including GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket, or any connected developer platform.  
AIM automatically aggregates repository data, identifies vulnerable or archived repos, and correlates each repo with associated assets, owners, and risk levels.

## Key Metrics & Analytics

The top analytics panel gives teams an instant understanding of repository health and security posture.

### **Metrics Displayed**
- **Total Repositories** — Total number of repositories discovered across integrations.
- **Vulnerable Repositories** — Repos associated with security issues or detected weaknesses.
- **Private Repositories** — Internal or restricted-access repos (0 in screenshot).
- **Public Repositories** — Repos exposed publicly (0 in screenshot).

## Activity Dashboard

<Frame caption="Repository Activity Distribution">
  <img src="/images/aim/repositories-activity.png" />
</Frame>

The **Activity Chart** shows commit and update frequency across timelines (Last Week, Last Month, Last 3 Months, etc.).  
This helps identify stagnant codebases, abandoned services, or actively developed projects.

---

## Archive Status

<Frame caption="Repository Archive Classification">
  <img src="/images/aim/repositories-archive.png" />
</Frame>

AIM detects whether a repository is:
- **Archived** — No longer maintained  
- **Active** — Still in use or being updated  

Archived repos often contain legacy code and may still expose risks if dependencies or secrets remain.

---

## Technology Distribution

Shows programming languages or tech stacks used across detected repositories.  
(Empty in screenshot → will populate when tech metadata is available.)

---

## Search, Filters & Sorting

To support deep analysis, users can filter repositories by:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Owners** | Filter repos by assigned owners or contributors. |
| **Risk** | Sort or filter via automated repository risk scoring. |
| **Exposure** | Identify repos linked with exposed assets. |
| **Adapters** | Filter by the integration source (e.g., GitLab adapter). |
| **hasVulns** | Show only repos containing vulnerabilities. |
| **Associations** | Filter repositories connected to other AIM assets. |

These filters help analysts quickly identify risky or abandoned codebases.

---

## Repository Table Details

Each repository entry includes:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | Repository URL or identifier. |
| **Source** | Detection method (e.g., gitlab). |
| **Vuln Count** | Total vulnerabilities linked with the repo. |
| **Auto Risk** | Automated risk score. |
| **Owner** | Team or user responsible for maintaining the repository. |
| **Language** | Primary programming language (if detected). |
| **Associations** | Number of linked assets (apps, services, domains, etc.). |
| **Pushed At** | Last code push timestamp. |
| **Created At** | Repository creation timestamp. |

## Full Repository View

Each repository page contains:

### **Summary**
- Repository link  
- Ownership  
- Risk score  
- Activity timeline  
- Exposure / associations  

### **Vulnerability Insights**
If repositories are linked with VM or SAST findings, they appear here:
- Severity breakdown  
- Discovery timeline  
- State and remediation history  

### **Metadata & Language Detection**
Programming language, frameworks, and package insights (when available).

### **Associations**
Shows related applications, APIs, certificates, or IPs.

## How Repositories Are Discovered

AIM detects repositories using:
- **GitLab Adapter** — Syncs repos, metadata, and activity logs.  
- **CI/CD Integrations** — Detects repos referenced in pipelines.  
- **VM adapter** — Maps vulnerabilities back to their source repos.  

This ensures AIM maintains a real-time inventory of your entire code ecosystem.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Security Teams:** Identify vulnerable or abandoned repos.  
- **Developers:** Track ownership and risk of application code.  
- **Compliance Teams:** Ensure all repositories meet governance requirements.  
- **Engineering Leaders:** Monitor development activity trends.
