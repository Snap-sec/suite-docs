## Repository Dashboard Overview

The **Repositories Catalog** provides a centralized dashboard showing all code repositories discovered across connected Git platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

This dashboard helps security and engineering teams understand repository posture at a glance — including activity, archive status, ownership, and risk.

### What the Dashboard Shows

- **Total Repositories** — Complete count of repositories discovered
- **Vulnerable Repositories** — Repositories linked to security findings
- **Private Repositories** — Internal or restricted repositories
- **Public Repositories** — Internet-facing repositories
- **Activity Panel** — Repository update or commit activity
- **Archive Status** — Archived vs active repositories
- **Technology Distribution** — Languages and tech stacks used (when available)

Below the analytics, the repository table allows users to:

- Search repositories by name  
- Filter by owner, risk, exposure, adapters, or vulnerability presence  
- Sort by activity, creation date, or risk score  

Each row represents a single repository discovered by AIM.

## Repository Asset View (Inside a Repository)

Clicking any repository opens its **Repository Asset View**, providing deep visibility into that specific codebase.

### Repository Summary Panel

Each repository asset includes:

- **Repository Name & Status** (Active / Inactive)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure Status** (Safe / Exposed)
- **Environment** (Prod, Dev, Unknown)
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By** (Owner or team)

Lifecycle actions available:
- **Decommission Asset**
- **Delete Asset**

### Repository Insights

Within the repository asset view, AIM provides:

- **Vulnerability Trends** — Historical vulnerability changes (if available)
- **Severity Distribution** — Breakdown of vulnerability severity
- **Tags** — Labels such as `GitHub`, `Repository`
- **Technologies** — Detected languages or frameworks (when available)
- **Asset Relations Graph** — Visual mapping of how the repository connects to:
  - Applications
  - APIs
  - Domains
  - Other assets

This view enables teams to trace security findings back to source code and understand downstream impact.
