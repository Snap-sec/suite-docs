## Overview

The **Certificates Library** provides centralized visibility into all SSL/TLS certificates discovered across your environment.  
It helps teams identify expired, invalid, or risky certificates and understand how they relate to domains and assets.

## Certificates Dashboard

The dashboard gives a high-level snapshot of certificate health across your organization:

- **Total Certificates** — All certificates discovered
- **Expired Certificates** — Certificates past validity
- **Nearly Expired Certificates** — Certificates nearing expiration
- **Invalid Certificates** — Certificates with trust or configuration issues

Visual analytics help you quickly understand:

- Certificate validity status
- Expiry timelines
- Certificate signing authorities in use

This view helps teams prioritize renewals and prevent service disruptions.

## Certificates Table

The certificates table lists every discovered SSL/TLS certificate with contextual metadata for investigation and triage.

### Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | Domain or hostname the certificate applies to |
| **Source** | Discovery adapter (e.g., sslcert) |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of vulnerabilities linked to the certificate |
| **Auto Risk** | System-generated risk score |
| **Owner** | Assigned owner or responsible team |
| **Tags** | Classification tags (e.g., SSL, Certificate) |
| **Associations** | Number of linked assets |
| **Detected On** | First and last discovery timestamps |

Filters allow narrowing by **Owner**, **Risk**, **Adapter**, and **Vulnerability presence**.

### Certificate Summary

The summary panel displays:

- **Certificate Value**
- **Status** (Active / Expired / Invalid)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure**
- **Environment**
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By**

Actions available:
- **Decommission Asset**
- **Delete Asset**

---

### Vulnerability & Severity Insights

Sections include:

- **Vulnerability Trends** — Historical vulnerability data (if available)
- **Severity Distribution** — Breakdown by severity level

These panels help assess whether the certificate introduces downstream risk.

---

### Tags & Technologies

- **Tags** — Labels such as `SSL`, `Certificate`
- **Technologies** — Manually added or detected technologies associated with the certificate

---

### Asset Relationships

The **Asset Relation Graph** visualizes how the certificate connects to other assets such as:

- Domains
- Subdomains
- APIs
- Applications

This relationship view helps teams understand impact radius before decommissioning or rotation.
