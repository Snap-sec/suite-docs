The **Certificates Catalog** in AIM provides full visibility into SSL/TLS certificate lifecycles — helping teams detect expired, invalid, shadowed, or soon-to-expire certificates before they cause outages or security incidents.

## Overview

The **Certificates Catalog** aggregates all SSL/TLS certificates discovered via ASM, VM, cloud integrations, or network scanners.

Each certificate entry includes:

- Expiry details  
- Signing authority  
- Mapped domains or services  
- Risk score & exposures  
- Validity status  
- Associations with other assets  

AIM continuously monitors certificate freshness and flags expired or invalid certificates instantly.

## Key Metrics & Analytics

### **Total Certificates**
Number of certificates actively tracked in AIM.

### **Expired Certificates**
Certificates past their expiration date, posing both availability and security risks.

### **Nearly Expired Certificates**
Certificates approaching expiry thresholds defined by your organization (e.g., 30 days).

### **Invalid Certificates**
Certificates that fail cryptographic, trust-chain, or configuration validation.

---

### **Certificate Validity Distribution**
Shows how long certificates have before expiry:

- **< 1 Month**
- **1–3 Months**
- **3–6 Months**
- **> 6 Months**

Useful for renewal planning and outage prevention.

### **Validity Status Breakdown**
Pie chart of:

- **Valid**
- **Expired**

### **Certificate Signing Authorities**
Distribution of CA providers such as:

- Let’s Encrypt  
- Cloudflare  
- CertUnity  
- Custom/Internal CA  

Helpful for compliance and CA governance.

## Search, Filters & Sorting

The certificate catalog supports powerful filters:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Owners** | Show certificates assigned to a specific user/team. |
| **Risk** | Sort by automated risk score. |
| **Source** | Filter by discovery adapters (ASM, VM, SSL scanners). |
| **hasVulns** | Show certificates linked with vulnerabilities. |
| **Organizations** | Filter by organization or CA issuing authority. |
| **Date Range** | Filter based on detection timeline. |

All filters stack for precise narrowing of certificate datasets.

---

## Certificate Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | Domain or service the certificate belongs to. |
| **Source** | The adapter that discovered it (e.g., sslcert). |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of vulnerabilities associated with this certificate. |
| **Auto Risk** | Automated risk score. |
| **Owner** | Responsible user or team. |
| **Tags** | Tags like `SSL`, `Certificate`, `TLS`. |
| **Associations** | Related assets (domains, IPs, APIs). |
| **Detected On** | First and last discovery timestamps. |

### Certificate Summary

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Certificate Value** | CN / SAN or linked domain. |
| **Validity Status** | Valid / Expired / Invalid. |
| **Expiry Date** | Exact expiration timestamp. |
| **Risk Score** | System-generated based on expiry, CA, and associations. |
| **Owner** | Assigned user or team. |
| **Environment** | Based on asset mappings (e.g., Prod, Staging). |
| **Lifecycle** | First Found / Last Found timelines. |

---

## Signing Authority Intelligence

AIM enriches each certificate with:

- **CA Name**  
- **Trust chain analysis**  
- **Issuer metadata**  
- **Key size & algorithm**  

This helps ensure cryptographic and compliance integrity.

---

## Associated Assets

Certificates automatically link to:

- Domains  
- Subdomains  
- APIs  
- IPs  
- Applications  

This helps identify the impact radius of expired or invalid certificates.

---

## How Certificates Are Discovered

AIM identifies certificates using:

- **ASM Adapter** – external scans & exposed endpoints  
- **VM Adapter** – vulnerability correlation  
- **SSL Cert Adapter** – certificate-specific discovery  
- **Cloud Integrations** – Cloudflare, AWS ACM, etc.  

---

## Example Use Cases

### 🔐 **Security Teams**
Identify weak, expired, or untrusted certificates.

### ⚙️ **DevOps / Platform Engineers**
Prevent service outages caused by certificate expiry.

### 🛡 Compliance Teams
Ensure CA policies, key sizes, and renewal practices meet standards.

### 🚨 Incident Responders
Investigate compromised or misissued certificates.
