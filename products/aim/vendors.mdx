## Overview

The **Vendor Inventory** dashboard provides a centralized view of all third-party vendors detected across your environment, such as identity providers, SaaS tools, cloud services, and external platforms.

This view helps security, IT, and compliance teams quickly understand vendor presence, ownership gaps, and potential third-party risk.

### What the Dashboard Shows

- **Vendor Cards** — Each card represents a detected vendor (e.g., Okta, GitHub, Slack).
- **Risk Status** — High-level risk indicator for the vendor (if available).
- **Members** — Number of employees associated with the vendor.
- **Search & Discovery** — Quickly locate vendors by name.
- **Entry Point** — Click **See more details** to drill into a specific vendor.

This dashboard acts as the starting point for third-party risk visibility.

## Vendor Asset View (Inside a Vendor)

Clicking on a vendor opens the **Vendor Asset View**, which provides a detailed profile of that specific third-party service.

### Vendor Summary Panel

Each vendor asset includes:

- **Vendor Name & Status** (Active / Inactive)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure Status** (Safe / Exposed)
- **Environment**
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By** (Owner or Unknown)

Available lifecycle actions:
- **Decommission Asset**
- **Delete Asset**

### Vendor Insights

Within the vendor asset view, AIM provides:

- **Vulnerability Trends** — Historical vulnerability data (if available)
- **Severity Distribution** — Breakdown of vulnerability severities
- **Tags** — Classification labels for the vendor
- **Technologies** — Technologies associated with the vendor (if detected)
- **Asset Relation Graph** — Visual mapping of how the vendor connects to:
  - Domains
  - Subdomains
  - Applications
  - Other assets

This view allows teams to assess vendor risk in context rather than isolation.

## Associated Assets

Vendors are rarely standalone. AIM links each vendor to the assets that depend on or integrate with it.

### What Associated Assets Show

- **Linked Assets** — Domains, subdomains, or applications connected to the vendor
- **Asset Type** — Clear labeling (e.g., Subdomain, Application)
- **Search & Filtering** — Quickly locate specific associations

This association layer is critical for:
- Understanding blast radius if a vendor is compromised
- Identifying business impact of third-party incidents
- Supporting vendor risk assessments and audits
