## Overview

The **Application Registry** provides a centralized view of all applications identified across your ecosystems — including web apps, internal tools, API services, and shadow applications.  
AIM automatically classifies each application, correlates vulnerabilities, and tracks ownership, risk, and exposure.

## Key Metrics

<Columns cols={4}>
  <Stat title="Total Applications" value="10" />
  <Stat title="Vulnerable Applications" value="6" />
  <Stat title="Exposed Applications" value="10" />
  <Stat title="Shadowed Applications" value="5" />
</Columns>

These metrics help security and IT teams quickly assess exposure and prioritize remediation.

---

## Vulnerability Insights

<Frame caption="Vulnerability Severity Breakdown">
  <img src="/images/aim/apps-vulns.png" />
</Frame>

The Application Registry aggregates vulnerability data and displays:

- **Critical**
- **High**
- **Medium**
- **Low**

Severity distributions help prioritize the most impactful fixes.

---

## Search, Filtering & Grouping

Users can filter and sort applications using:

| Filter | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Owners** | Filter by application owner or responsible team |
| **Risk Score** | Sort apps by automated risk scoring |
| **Exposure** | Show exposed, safe, or shadow apps |
| **Adapters** | View applications discovered via specific integrations |
| **hasVulns** | Only display vulnerable applications |
| **Last Seen** | Filter based on detection timeline |

These controls ensure fast triage and navigation through complex inventories.

---

## Application Table Columns

Each application entry displays structured metadata:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Application Name** | The registered or detected name |
| **Source** | Adapter or input source (ASM, VM, API Sec, CSV) |
| **Vulnerability Count** | Number of linked vulnerabilities |
| **Risk Score** | Automatically computed risk value |
| **Type** | Application type (Web, API, SaaS, Internal) |
| **Owner** | Assigned user or team |
| **Tags** | Labels like `vm`, `application`, `internal` |
| **Associations** | Linked assets (domains, APIs, repos) |
| **Detected On** | First and last detection timestamps |

---

## Full Application View

Each application includes a detailed internal profile.

### Application Summary

A summary card displays:

- Application Name  
- Status (Active, Inactive, Unknown)  
- Total Linked Vulnerabilities  
- Risk Score  
- Exposure (Exposed or Safe)  
- Environment (Prod, Dev, Staging)  
- Owner  
- Detection Timeline  

### Vulnerability Analysis

<Frame caption="Application Vulnerability Trends">
  <img src="/images/aim/apps-trends.png" />
</Frame>

Users can view:

- Historical vulnerability trends  
- Severity distribution  
- Detailed vulnerability table with state & history  

All findings link back to VM for deeper triage.

---

## Tags, Technologies & Components

- **Tags:** Business labels or security classification  
- **Technologies:** Libraries, frameworks, or platforms detected (e.g., Nginx, Node.js, Django)  
- **Components:** Linked APIs, subdomains, containers, or cloud resources  

This enables accurate dependency mapping and impact assessment.

---

## Asset Relations

<Frame caption="Application Asset Graph">
  <img src="/images/aim/app-relations.png" />
</Frame>

The relation graph maps relationships between:

- Applications  
- APIs  
- Domains  
- IPs  
- Certificates  
- Cloud components  

This reveals attack paths and dependencies.

---

## Ownership & Lifecycle Controls

Each application includes lifecycle management actions:

- **Assign Owner**
- **Update Metadata**
- **Decommission Application**
- **Delete Application**

Changes synchronize across AIM and related modules.

---

## How Applications Are Discovered

Applications are detected through:

- **ASM Adapter** — external surface scans  
- **VM Adapter** — vulnerability imports  
- **API Sec Adapter** — request-based discovery  
- **TechDetect Adapter** — technology fingerprinting  
- **Manual Input / CSV Uploads**  

This ensures a continuously accurate application inventory.

---

## Example Use Cases

### Security Teams
Identify vulnerable or exposed applications quickly.

### Asset Managers
Track application ownership and maintain accurate registries.

### DevSecOps
Monitor application posture and ensure compliance.

### Incident Response
Investigate affected applications during incidents.
