## Application Inventory Overview

The **Application Inventory** dashboard provides a centralized view of all applications discovered across your organization, including internal apps, APIs, and externally exposed services.

It helps teams understand application exposure, vulnerability concentration, and ownership at a glance.

### What the Dashboard Shows

- **Total Applications** discovered
- **Vulnerable Applications** with linked security findings
- **Exposed Applications** reachable from external networks
- **Shadowed Applications** without clear ownership or classification

### Visual Insights

- **Vulnerability Distribution** by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Application Distribution** across environments
- **Exposure-based breakdown** for prioritization

### Application Table

The table lists all discovered applications with key metadata:

| Column | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | Application name or identifier |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of linked vulnerabilities |
| **Auto Risk** | System-calculated risk score |
| **Type** | Application type |
| **Owner** | Assigned application owner |
| **Tags** | Labels such as `vm`, `application` |
| **Associations** | Linked assets |
| **Detected On** | First and last discovery timestamps |

This view is used to triage, filter, and select applications for deeper inspection.

- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure** (Exposed or Safe)
- **Environment**
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By (Owner)**

Lifecycle actions available:
- **Decommission Asset**
- **Delete Asset**

### Vulnerability Insights

- Vulnerability trend panel
- Severity distribution panel  
(Displayed when vulnerability data is available)

### Metadata & Relationships

Inside an application asset, you can view and manage:

- **Tags** for classification
- **Technologies** associated with the application
- **Open Ports** (if detected)
- **Asset Relations Graph** showing connections to:
  - Domains
  - APIs
  - Certificates
  - Other linked assets

This view helps teams understand **blast radius**, dependencies, and risk impact before remediation or decommissioning.
