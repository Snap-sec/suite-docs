## Overview

The **Compartment Inventory** provides a structured view of all OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) compartments within your organization.  
It helps teams clearly differentiate **production**, **staging**, **development**, and **platform-specific** environments — ensuring accurate access control, asset association, and lifecycle oversight.

## Compartment Structure & Status

Each compartment entry includes:

- **Compartment Name** – such as *Systems-Production*, *OCMDevelopment*, or *Platform-Staging*  
- **Lifecycle Status** – Active / Deleted, based on the OCI sync  
- **ARN Identifier** – full OCI resource ID for traceability  
- **Associated Assets** – number of assets mapped inside the compartment

<Info>
Active compartments represent live cloud environments. Deleted compartments indicate resources removed from OCI but retained in AIM for audit history.

## Key Features

### 🔹 Environment Mapping  
Compartments are automatically grouped by their purpose — such as:

- **Production**
- **Staging**
- **Development**
- **Platform**
- **Security**

This gives security and infra teams a real-time understanding of their cloud architecture.

---

### 🔹 Lifecycle Visibility  
Every compartment shows whether it is:

- **ACTIVE** — currently available in OCI  
- **DELETED** — removed but retained for visibility  

Deleted compartments help ensure no orphaned assets or IAM policies remain unnoticed.

---

### 🔹 Asset Association Insights  
Each entry displays how many assets are tied to the compartment:

This is useful for identifying compartments that:

- Should be cleaned up  
- Are incorrectly empty  
- Contain high-value or sensitive workloads

## Example Compartment Types

Some environments identified in your screenshot include:

- **Systems-Production**  
- **Security-Production**  
- **Platform-Production / Platform-Staging**  
- **OCM-Development / OCM-Production**  
- **Payment-Development**  
- **sysops-staging-bgqH5qLo** (Deleted)  
- **sysops-production-haQ92vWN** (Deleted)

AIM aggregates all these into a single unified monitoring interface.
