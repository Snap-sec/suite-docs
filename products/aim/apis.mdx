## Overview

The **API Catalog** in AIM provides centralized visibility into every API and endpoint discovered across your organization.  
It combines analytics, exposure intelligence, and risk scoring to help teams understand their API landscape and mitigate risks proactively.

## Overview

The **API Catalog** serves as a comprehensive inventory of all APIs identified through integrations, scanners, or adapters (such as Postman, VM, or TechDetect).  
It consolidates discovery, vulnerability data, request method analytics, and exposure indicators into one unified interface.

This catalog empowers teams to monitor shadow APIs, enforce ownership, and ensure complete coverage across internal, external, and partner APIs.

## Search, Filters, and Sorting

The API catalog supports multi-dimensional filtering for precise visibility and control:

| Filter | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Owners** | Filter by assigned API owner or responsible workspace. |
| **Risk** | Filter APIs based on calculated Auto Risk score. |
| **Exposure** | Show APIs that are exposed or shadowed. |
| **Adapters** | Filter APIs imported from specific adapters (e.g., Postman, VM, or TechDetect). |
| **Tags** | Filter APIs by technology or business tags (e.g., `Postman`, `API`). |
| **hasVulns** | Show APIs with linked vulnerabilities. |
| **Date Range** | Filter by first or last discovery date. |

These filters make it easy to pinpoint unowned APIs, newly discovered endpoints, or those with elevated risk.

---

## API Table Columns

Each API record includes rich contextual data:

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | API name or workspace identifier. |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of vulnerabilities linked to the API. |
| **Workspace** | The Postman or internal workspace where the API resides. |
| **Auto Risk** | Automatically computed risk score based on vulnerabilities, exposure, and classification rules. |
| **Total Endpoints** | Total number of active endpoints within the API. |
| **Owner** | Assigned person or workspace responsible for the API. |
| **Tags** | Technology or discovery tags (e.g., `Postman`, `API`). |
| **Associations** | Related assets connected to the API. |
| **Detected On** | Timestamp of last discovery and first identification. |

### API Summary

<Frame caption="API Full View">
  <img src="/images/aim/api3.png" alt="API Detailed View in AIM" />
</Frame>

At the top of the page, the API summary provides quick access to its key attributes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **API Name** | Name of the API asset (e.g., `snapsec Control`). |
| **Status** | Indicates if the API is Active or Decommissioned. |
| **Source** | Displays which adapter or workspace provided the API (e.g., Postman). |
| **Exposed** | Marks whether the API is exposed to public networks. |
| **Environment** | Identifies the deployment environment (e.g., Production, Staging, Dev). |
| **Risk Score** | Shows the calculated Auto Risk value. |
| **Managed By** | Lists the assigned owner or team responsible for maintenance. |
| **Detection History** | Shows first and last detection timestamps. |

### Vulnerability Insights
<Frame caption="API Full View">
  <img src="/images/aim/api4.png" alt="API Detailed View in AIM" />
</Frame>

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Vulnerability Trends" icon="chart-line">
  Visual representation of vulnerabilities over time for the selected API, showing how remediation affects the trend line.
</Card>

<Card title="Severity Distribution" icon="circle-exclamation">
  Distribution chart showing vulnerabilities categorized as Critical, High, Medium, or Low.
</Card>

</Columns>

Below the trend charts, the **Vulnerabilities Table** lists all identified API-level issues, including:
- Vulnerability title  
- Assessment source  
- Severity  
- State (`Resolved`, `In Review`, `Retest`)  
- Detection history

### Tags, Technologies, and Relations

<Frame caption="API Full View">
  <img src="/images/aim/api5.png" alt="API Detailed View in AIM" />
</Frame>

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Tags" icon="tags">
  Tags applied automatically from adapters or manually by teams (e.g., `Postman`, `API`, `Internal`).
</Card>

<Card title="Technologies" icon="microchip">
  Lists backend technologies or services powering the API (e.g., Node.js, FastAPI, Flask).
</Card>

</Columns>


The **Asset Relation Graph** maps API dependencies and associations (e.g., linked IPs, domains, or related endpoints), allowing teams to visualize API surface connectivity.

---

### Endpoints and Methods

<Frame caption="API Full View">
  <img src="/images/aim/api6.png" alt="API Detailed View in AIM" />
</Frame>

Each API includes a full list of associated endpoints, including:

| Column | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Endpoint or request title. |
| **Method** | HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). |
| **Path** | API route or path identifier. |
| **URL** | Full request URL. |
| **Collection** | Postman collection or internal group reference. |
| **Workspace** | Workspace in which the API is registered. |

This section enables analysts to trace vulnerabilities, analyze endpoint exposure, and audit HTTP method usage patterns.

---

### Ownership & Management Actions

Each API asset supports lifecycle operations:
- **Assign Owner** – designate an individual or workspace owner.  
- **Decommission API** – mark outdated APIs for archival or removal.  
- **Delete API** – remove from active inventory.  

All ownership and lifecycle changes are synchronized across the AIM ecosystem.

---

## How APIs Are Discovered

AIM continuously updates API data using connected adapters and integrations:
- **Postman Adapter** – imports APIs and collections from workspaces.  
- **TechDetect Adapter** – fingerprints API technologies and request methods.  
- **VM Adapter** – enriches APIs with vulnerability data from security assessments.  

Each discovery refreshes endpoint counts, exposure states, and vulnerability analytics automatically.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **API Security Teams:** Identify shadow or unmanaged APIs.  
- **Developers:** Track active endpoints and ensure alignment with environment policies.  
- **Compliance Officers:** Audit exposed APIs for data sensitivity and regulatory controls.  
- **Engineering Leads:** Measure API growth and assess operational risks.
