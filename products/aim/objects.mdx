## Overview

The **Object Storage** module provides centralized visibility into all cloud storage buckets discovered across your environments.  
It highlights exposure status, ownership gaps, associations, and risk posture — helping teams secure publicly accessible or misconfigured buckets before they become threat vectors.

- **Tested Buckets**  
  Buckets processed or scanned by security tools for additional insights.

- **Exposure Repositories**  
  Number of repositories or linked assets that introduce risk to a bucket.

## What You Can Do

- **Identify exposed buckets** before they lead to data leakage  
- ** Correlate buckets with applications, repositories, and IPs**  
- **Assign owners** to ensure accountability  
- **Track detection timelines** to understand lifecycle and activity  
- **Filter by adapters, risk, exposure, or vulnerabilities** for fast triage
