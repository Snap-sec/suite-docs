## Overview

The **Object Storage** dashboard provides a centralized view of all cloud storage buckets discovered across supported cloud providers such as **AWS S3**, **Azure Blob Storage**, and **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.

This dashboard helps security and cloud teams quickly understand storage exposure, ownership gaps, and potential risk signals.

### What the Dashboard Shows

- **Total Buckets** — Total number of discovered object storage buckets  
- **Exposed Buckets** — Buckets that may be publicly accessible or misconfigured  
- **Tested Buckets** — Buckets assessed through connected security scanners  
- **Exposure Repositories** — Linked assets or services interacting with buckets  

Below the summary metrics, the bucket table allows teams to:

- Search buckets by name  
- Filter by **Owner**, **Risk**, **Exposure**, **Adapters**, or **Vulnerability presence**  
- View vulnerability count, auto risk score, and associations  
- Track **first found** and **last found** timestamps  

Each row represents a single object storage bucket managed within AIM.

## Object Storage Asset View (Inside a Bucket)

Selecting a bucket opens its **Object Storage Asset View**, offering detailed visibility into configuration, risk posture, and relationships.

</Frame>

### Bucket Summary Panel

Each object storage asset includes:

- **Bucket Name & Status** (Active / Inactive)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure Status** (Safe / Exposed)
- **Environment** (Prod, Dev, Unknown)
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By** (Owner or team)

Available lifecycle actions:
- **Decommission Asset**
- **Delete Asset**

### Bucket Insights

Within the asset view, AIM provides:

- **Vulnerability Trends** — Historical vulnerability data (when available)
- **Severity Distribution** — Breakdown of detected issues by severity
- **Tags** — Classification labels for governance and filtering
- **Technologies** — Related services or storage technologies
- **Asset Relations Graph** — Visual mapping showing how the bucket is:
  - Hosted by cloud vendors
  - Connected to applications or services
  - Related to other assets in the environment

This view enables teams to understand storage exposure in context and trace how sensitive data stores connect to the wider attack surface.
