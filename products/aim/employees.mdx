## Employee Inventory Overview

The **Employee Inventory** dashboard provides a high-level view of all employee-linked identities discovered across your organization.  
It helps security and IAM teams understand workforce exposure, vendor usage, and identity distribution at a glance.

### What the Dashboard Shows

- **Total Employees** — Count of all discovered employee identities  
- **Internal Employees** — Identities using organization-managed domains  
- **External Employees** — Vendor, contractor, or partner identities  

### Visual Insights Available

- **Vendor Distribution** — Breakdown of identity providers and associated domains  
- **User Activity** — Login activity timelines (inactive, long-dormant, recently active)  
- **Internal vs External Users** — Proportional view of workforce composition  

### Employee Inventory Table

Each row represents a discovered employee identity with:

- **Employee Email / Identity**
- **Source** (CSV, vendor, or integration)
- **Vulnerability Count**
- **Auto Risk Score**
- **Owner**
- **Tags**
- **Asset Associations**
- **Detection Timeline**

This view allows teams to quickly spot unused accounts, external identities, or unowned employee records.

## Employee Asset View

Clicking an employee opens the **Employee Asset Detail View**, providing full visibility into that identity’s risk, activity, and relationships.

### Employee Summary

Each employee asset displays:

- **Identity Value** (email or username)
- **Status** (Active / Decommissioned)
- **Total Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk Score**
- **Exposure Status**
- **Environment**
- **First Found / Last Found**
- **Managed By**

### Available Actions

- **Decommission Asset** — Mark the employee identity as inactive  
- **Delete Asset** — Permanently remove the identity  

### Asset Intelligence Sections

- **Vulnerability Trends** — Historical vulnerability data (if available)  
- **Severity Distribution** — Risk severity breakdown  
- **Tags** — Classification labels (employee, internal, external, vendor)  
- **Technologies** — Associated platforms (if detected)  
- **Open Ports** — Network exposure (if applicable)  

### Asset Relation Graph

The **Asset Relation** graph visually maps how the employee identity connects to:

- Applications  
- Domains  
- Other assets  

This helps understand access scope and potential blast radius during incidents or offboarding.
