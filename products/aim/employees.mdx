## Overview

The Employee Catalog aggregates all employee-linked identities discovered from CSV imports, HR systems, SSO platforms, and external vendors.

Each employee record contains:
- Email identity  
- Associated vendor/platform  
- Login activity timelines  
- Internal vs. external classification  
- Exposure and risk scoring  
- Asset associations across your organization  

This enables security teams to track identity drift, unused accounts, shadow employee identities, and stale vendor accounts.

## Key Metrics & Analytics

<Columns cols={3}>

<Card title="Total Employees" icon="users">
  Shows the total number of employees with active or historical accounts.
</Card>

<Card title="Internal vs External" icon="arrows-left-right">
  Tracks whether an identity is internal (organization-managed) or external (vendor, contractor, or partner).
</Card>

<Card title="Vendor Distribution" icon="building">
  Visualizes which vendors (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, GitHub) employees are associated with.
</Card>

</Columns>

  <img src="/images/aim/employees2.png" />
</Frame>

This pie chart helps visualize where employee-linked accounts originate from — such as:
- Corporate domains  
- External providers  
- SaaS platforms  
- Partner organizations  

---

## User Activity

<Frame caption="Employee Login Activity">
  <img src="/images/aim/employees3.png" />
</Frame>

AIM tracks account activity by:
- Last login  
- Monthly usage trends  
- Inactive or long-dormant accounts  

This helps teams identify:
- Accounts that should be disabled  
- Unused or orphaned vendor identities  
- Potential abandoned access points  

---

## Internal & External User Breakdown

<Frame caption="Internal vs External Distribution">
  <img src="/images/aim/employees4.png" />
</Frame>

Employees are classified as:
- **Internal** — company-managed email/domain  
- **External** — contractors, freelancers, partners, or vendor-associated accounts  

This ensures accurate access governance.

## Search, Filters & Sorting

A powerful filtering system allows analysts to quickly identify risky or unused identities.

### Available Filters
| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Type** | Internal or external identities |
| **Last Seen** | Filters based on last login or activity |
| **Vendors** | Email provider or authentication source |
| **Risk** | Auto-generated risk score |
| **Tags** | Assigned metadata or labels |

Filters can be combined for deeper identity investigations.

## Ownership & Lifecycle Controls

Each employee identity supports the following actions:

All lifecycle updates sync across AIM and other connected modules.

## How Employees Are Discovered

AIM discovers employee identities using:
- **CSV imports**
- **SSO / IAM platforms**
- **Vendor identity integrations**
- **ASM or VM adapters**
- **Email domain enumeration**

This ensures up-to-date identity tracking.
