## Overview

The **Technology Index** provides a unified catalog of every technology detected across your infrastructure — including frameworks, libraries, languages, server technologies, and third-party components.

AIM automatically correlates these technologies with assets, environments, and exposure levels to help teams understand where critical dependencies exist and what risks they introduce.

## Key Metrics

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Total Technologies" icon="cube">
    Total unique technologies detected across all assets.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Internal Technologies" icon="building-lock">
    Technologies found exclusively in internal or private environments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="External Technologies" icon="globe">
    Technologies detected on publicly exposed or internet-facing assets.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Technology Usage Distribution

<Frame caption="Technology Usage Chart">
  <img src="/images/aim/tech/tech2.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

This visualization shows which technologies are most commonly used across your environment, helping teams quickly identify:

- High-dependency frameworks  
- Legacy or low-usage libraries  
- Technology clusters that may require deeper risk analysis  

---

## Exposure Distribution

<Frame caption="Internal vs External Technology Exposure">
  <img src="/images/aim/tech/tech3.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

Exposure data highlights whether a technology is used on **external** or **internal** surfaces — critical for:

- Prioritizing patching based on exposure  
- Identifying externally-accessible components  
- Understanding attack surface expansion  

---

## Environment Distribution

<Frame caption="Environment Mapping">
  <img src="/images/aim/tech/tech4.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

This section shows where technologies are deployed across environments like:

- Production  
- Staging  
- Development  
- Shadow environments

## Technology Directory

Below the analytics dashboard, AIM provides a searchable directory of all detected technologies.

Each item includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Technology Name** | Framework, library, or component (e.g., React, Nginx, TLS). |
| **Asset Count** | Number of assets using that technology. |
| **Source** | Adapter or discovery method that detected it. |
| **Tags** | Business or technical classification tags. |
| **Associations** | Related assets, clusters, or dependencies. |

## Technology Details (Full View)

Each technology includes a dedicated detail page providing:

### 🔹 Summary
- Technology name  
- Type (Framework, Server, Library, Protocol)  
- Exposure level  
- Total assets using it  

### 🔹 Associated Assets  
List of all assets (IPs, domains, applications, etc.) linked with this technology.

### 🔹 Tags & Metadata  
Automatic or manual tags applied for classification.

### 🔹 Discovery Timeline  
- First detection  
- Last detection  
- Associated adapters

## How Technologies Are Detected

AIM identifies technologies using a combination of:

- ASM technology signatures  
- VM vulnerability fingerprints  
- Request/response pattern analysis  
- Headers, banners, and server metadata  
- Frontend technology detection  
- API schema and response pattern identification  

This ensures full-stack coverage across APIs, servers, web apps, and more.
