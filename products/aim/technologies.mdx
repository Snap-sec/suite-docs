## Overview

The **Technology Index dashboard** provides a high-level view of all technologies detected across your environment.  
It helps teams understand technology sprawl, external exposure, and dependency concentration at a glance.

The dashboard highlights:
- **Total Technologies** discovered
- **Total Assets** using those technologies
- **Internal vs External technologies**
- **Usage distribution** across frameworks, libraries, servers, and protocols
- **Exposure breakdown** to identify internet-facing dependencies

These insights allow security and engineering teams to quickly spot risky or overused technologies.

## Technology Inventory List

Below the dashboard, AIM presents a **searchable technology inventory** showing every detected technology as an individual entry.

</Frame>

Each technology card displays:
- **Technology name** (e.g., TLS, Nginx, React, Node.js)
- **Number of associated assets**
- **Category / Type** (framework, protocol, library, server, etc.)

This list enables teams to:
- Identify widely used dependencies
- Locate rarely used or unexpected technologies
- Quickly pivot into affected assets for investigation

## Technology Detail View

Clicking on any technology opens its **Technology Detail view**, which provides asset-level visibility.

</Frame>

The detail view includes:
- **Technology name**
- **Total assets using this technology**
- **List of associated assets** (domains, subdomains, applications, APIs)
- Scrollable asset list for quick navigation

This view helps teams understand:
- Where a technology is deployed
- Which assets would be impacted by a vulnerability or upgrade
- Dependency concentration across critical services
