## DNS Dashboard Overview

The **DNS Catalog Dashboard** provides a centralized view of all discovered DNS records across your environments.  
It helps security and infrastructure teams quickly understand DNS exposure, ownership, and risk at scale.

## Key Metrics & Visibility

The dashboard highlights high-level DNS posture through summary metrics:

- **Total Records** — All DNS records discovered  
- **Internal Records** — DNS entries mapped to internal assets  
- **External Records** — Records resolving to external hosts  
- **CNAME Records** — Canonical name mappings  

Visual charts provide instant insight into:

- DNS records per domain  
- Exposure distribution (Internal vs External)  
- DNS record type distribution  

This allows teams to quickly identify risky or externally exposed DNS entries.

## DNS Records Table

The DNS inventory table lists every discovered record with searchable and filterable metadata.

Available columns include:

- **Record Value** — IP address or hostname  
- **Vulnerability Count** — Linked vulnerabilities (if any)  
- **Host** — Associated host (if available)  
- **Type** — DNS record type (A, CNAME, etc.)  
- **Owner** — Assigned owner or team  
- **Tags** — Classification labels  
- **Associations** — Linked assets  
- **Detected On** — First and last detection timestamps  

This table acts as the primary entry point for deeper DNS asset analysis.

## DNS Asset Detail View

Clicking a DNS record opens the **DNS Asset Detail View**, providing a complete breakdown of that specific asset.

</Frame>

### Asset Summary

Each DNS asset includes:

- Current status (Active / Decommissioned)  
- Total vulnerabilities linked  
- Risk score  
- Exposure classification  
- Environment context  
- First and last detection dates  
- Assigned owner  

---

### Asset Relationships

The **Asset Relation Graph** visualizes how the DNS record connects to other assets such as:

- APIs  
- Applications  
- IP addresses  
- Services  

This relationship mapping helps teams understand blast radius and dependency chains.

---

### Additional Asset Context

From the asset detail page, teams can also view and manage:

- **Tags** — For classification and tracking  
- **Technologies** — Detected tech stack (if available)  
- **Open Ports** — Network exposure details  

---

## Decommission DNS Asset

DNS records that are no longer valid or required can be safely decommissioned.

When decommissioning an asset:

- A **reason for decommissioning** is required  
- The asset is marked as inactive  
- Historical data remains preserved for audit and tracking  

This ensures DNS hygiene while maintaining a clear audit trail.

---

## Why Decommission DNS Assets?

Common use cases include:

- Removing stale or unused DNS records  
- Cleaning up legacy infrastructure entries  
- Reducing attack surface exposure  
- Preventing dangling or orphaned DNS mappings  

Decommissioning helps maintain an accurate and secure DNS inventory.
