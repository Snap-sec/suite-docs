## Overview

The **DNS Catalog** centralizes every DNS record discovered through adapters, scanners, and integrations.  
AIM automatically enriches each DNS asset with metadata, exposure insights, ownership information, and associated risks.

Each DNS entry represents an active, shadowed, or historical DNS record mapped to your environment.

## Key Metrics & Analytics

- **Total DNS Records** — Number of DNS assets tracked across all zones and environments.  
- **Vulnerable Records** — DNS assets associated with vulnerabilities or risky linked assets.  
- **Shadowed DNS** — DNS records not registered or not managed inside official systems.  
- **Record-Type Distribution** — Breakdown by A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, NS, SRV, etc.  
- **Exposure Distribution** — DNS pointing to exposed or risky endpoints.  
- **Zone/Provider Breakdown** — Top DNS zones, registrars, and providers.

## Search, Filters & Sorting

AIM provides advanced filtering to analyze DNS assets quickly.

| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Record Type** | Filter A, AAAA, TXT, MX, CNAME, and other record types. |
| **Exposure** | Identify DNS records pointing to exposed or shadowed assets. |
| **Owners** | Filter based on assigned user/team owners. |
| **Risk** | Sort or filter by automated AIM risk score. |
| **Adapters** | Filter DNS discovered via Cloudflare, Route53, GitHub, ASM, etc. |
| **hasVulns** | Show DNS records linked to vulnerable assets. |
| **Organisations** | Filter by DNS zone or hosting provider. |
| **Date Range** | Filter by detection timeline. |

---

## DNS Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Record Value** | The DNS name + record type (e.g., `api.example.com` – A). |
| **Target** | IP, domain, or service the DNS record resolves to. |
| **Record Type** | A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, SRV, etc. |
| **Exposure** | Whether the target is exposed, internal, or shadowed. |
| **Risk Score** | AIM risk score calculated from target exposure + vulnerabilities. |
| **Zone / Provider** | DNS zone owner and DNS hosting provider. |
| **Owner** | User or team responsible for the DNS record. |
| **Tags** | Classification tags such as external, internal, risky, cloud. |
| **Associations** | Linked assets (IP, subdomain, apps). |
| **Detected On** | First/Last seen timestamps for tracking lifecycle. |

### DNS Summary Panel

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Record Name** | DNS name being analyzed. |
| **Record Type** | A, CNAME, TXT, MX, etc. |
| **Resolved Target** | IP, hostname, or service it maps to. |
| **Exposure** | Whether the resolved target is exposed or safe. |
| **Risk Score** | Auto-generated risk score. |
| **Environment** | Prod, staging, dev — if classified. |
| **Managed By** | Assigned owner or team. |
| **Detection Timeline** | First and last detection timestamps. |

## Vulnerability & Exposure Insights

DNS records inherit risk from the assets they point to.

### What AIM Shows:

- Vulnerabilities on linked IPs, domains, or applications  
- Severity distribution  
- Exposure state of the target (Exposed / Internal / Shadowed)  
- Historical vulnerability trends

## Tags, Technologies & Resolved Targets

- **Tags** — internal, core-service, third-party, external, etc.  
- **Technologies** — derived from the resolved IP/application.  
- **Resolved Targets** — all IPs or domains the DNS record currently resolves to (supporting multi-value records).

---

## Zone & Provider Intelligence

AIM enriches DNS assets automatically:

- Zone (e.g., `example.com`)
- Registrar (Cloudflare, AWS Route53, Google DNS)
- TTL  
- DNSSEC status  
- Hosting provider metadata  

This helps detect misconfigurations, shadowed DNS, or risky ownership gaps.

---

## Asset Relations

The relation graph reveals:

- Linked IPs  
- Applications  
- Certificates  
- Subdomains  
- Associated technologies  

Ideal for mapping spiderweb connections across your environment.

---

## Ownership & Lifecycle Management

DNS assets support full lifecycle actions:

- **Assign Owner**  
- **Decommission Record**  
- **Delete Asset**  
- **Reactivate Asset**  

All changes sync with AIM’s automation and adapters.

## How DNS Records Are Discovered

AIM detects and updates DNS records via:

- **ASM Adapter** — pulls DNS from external attack surface mapping  
- **Cloudflare Adapter**  
- **AWS Route53 Adapter**  
- **GitHub / Repos** (for config-as-code DNS references)  
- **TechDetect** — resolves DNS to IPs & technologies  

Combined, these ensure real-time DNS inventory accuracy.

---

## Example Use Cases

- **Security Teams** — detect DNS pointing to vulnerable servers.  
- **IT & Networking** — track unmanaged or shadow DNS records.  
- **Incident Response** — investigate DNS used in attacks.  
- **Compliance** — ensure DNS inventory is complete and compliant.
