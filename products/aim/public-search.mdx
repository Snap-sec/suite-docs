## Overview

The **Public Asset Catalog** allows companies to share controlled access to asset data outside the main Snapsec portal.  
This enables teams, partners, or external auditors to view and search assets, vulnerabilities, or exposure data **without requiring platform login credentials**.

It’s ideal for providing transparent visibility while maintaining strict edit permissions and audit trails.

## Purpose

The goal of the **Public Catalog** is to make asset intelligence accessible to distributed or external teams while retaining ownership and data security.

- 🔍 **Search & View Assets** — Users can search by domain, IP, repository, or keyword to view relevant asset records.  
- 📊 **Transparency** — Ideal for vendor assessments, audit reviews, and public collaboration.  
- ✏️ **Controlled Edits** — Optionally enable external contributors to edit asset fields (like owner or environment) without full portal access.  
- 🔐 **Secure Access** — Links are unique and permission-restricted, ensuring limited scope visibility.

The results show asset details like risk scores, vulnerabilities, relationships, tags, and associated owners.

## Sharing with Team Members

You can share either of the following links based on your use case:

| Type | Description | Recommended For |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Global Asset Search** | Read-only view to explore assets and vulnerabilities. | Auditors, Viewers, Compliance Teams |
| **Edit Asset Link** | Editable view to update metadata fields like Owner, Exposure, or Environment. | Internal Teams, Asset Managers |

> ⚠️ **Tip:** Use the edit link cautiously — changes made here are directly reflected in the live AIM database.

---

## Best Practices

- Limit public link sharing to trusted users or teams.  
- Use the **read-only link** for transparency and reporting.  
- Periodically regenerate or disable old links to maintain access control.  
- Track edits through audit logs for accountability.
