Adapters in AIM act as **data bridges** between your asset inventory and external platforms.  
They automatically fetch, synchronize, and enrich asset data from connected systems — ensuring your inventory stays continuously updated without manual effort.

## What Are Adapters?

Adapters are modular integrations that connect AIM with external data sources such as:

- **Cloud Providers** – e.g., Oracle Cloud, Cloudflare  
- **Security Tools** – e.g., Snapsec ASM, VM, TechDetect, Secret Scanner  
- **Repositories & CI/CD** – e.g., GitHub, GitLab  
- **API Platforms** – e.g., Postman, Swagger  
- **Data Enrichment Sources** – e.g., IPinfo, CertGrabber, DNS Resolver  

Each adapter has a specific function — such as importing subdomains, fetching IP data, syncing vulnerabilities, or identifying technologies.

## Connecting Adapters

Connecting an adapter allows AIM to pull data automatically from that system into your asset inventory.

1. Navigate to the **Adapters** tab.
2. Click **Install** on the adapter you wish to connect (e.g., *Postman*, *Cloudflare*, *GitHub*).
3. Enter the required credentials or API key in the connection form.
4. Optionally, provide a description or context for the integration.
5. Click **Install Now** to activate the adapter.

Once installed, AIM begins fetching and enriching assets automatically based on that adapter’s capability.

## Disconnecting Adapters

If an integration is no longer required or needs replacement, it can be easily disconnected.

1. Open the **Active Adapters** tab.  
2. Locate the adapter you want to remove.  
3. Click **Delete** — this will safely disconnect the adapter without removing previously fetched data.  

Disconnected adapters can be reinstalled at any time.

---

## Active Adapters

The **Active Adapters** tab lists all currently configured integrations.  
Each card displays:

- **Adapter Name** (e.g., `crt`, `vm`, `techdetect`)  
- **Description** (e.g., *Fetching Subdomains for bugcrowd.com*)  
- **Status** (`Installed`)  
- **Last Sync Time** (e.g., “2 months ago”)  

You can manually trigger a sync or remove an adapter from here using **Refresh** or **Delete** actions.

## Refreshing Adapters

Refreshing an adapter allows AIM to fetch the latest data from that integration on-demand.

- Click the **Refresh** button on any active adapter card.  
- AIM will initiate an immediate sync to pull updated assets or vulnerability data.  
- The process is logged automatically under **Refresh Logs**.

This is especially useful after major changes in external systems or new asset additions.

---

## Refresh Logs

The **Refresh Logs** tab provides a complete audit trail of adapter activities.

Each log entry includes:
- Adapter name  
- User who triggered the installation or refresh  
- Action type (e.g., *installed*, *refreshed*)  
- Timestamp of the action  

This helps teams maintain transparency around data synchronization and integration changes.

## Adapter Lifecycle

| Stage | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Install** | Adapter is connected and credentials validated. |
| **Sync** | Data import begins automatically after installation. |
| **Refresh** | Manually trigger new data pull anytime. |
| **Disconnect** | Adapter removed without deleting existing data. |
| **Reinstall** | Reconnect adapter using stored credentials or a new API key. |

## Example Use Cases

- **Sync Subdomains:** Use CRT, DNS Resolver, or Snapsec ASM adapters to import discovered subdomains.  
- **Fetch Vulnerabilities:** Integrate with the VM adapter to bring in risk data for associated assets.  
- **Enrich IP Data:** Connect IPinfo to map IP locations, ASN data, and ownership.  
- **Automate Technology Detection:** Use TechDetect to fingerprint technology stacks automatically.  
- **Pull Repositories:** Link GitHub or GitLab adapters to track repositories as assets.
