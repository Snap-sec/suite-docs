The **Asset Classifier Engine** in AIM allows teams to automate how assets are categorized, enriched, and tagged — using powerful, YAML-based rules.  
It helps standardize how your organization detects environments, assigns ownership, and marks exposure, eliminating manual data management across large inventories.

## What is the Asset Classifier Engine?

The **Asset Classifier Engine** is an automation framework built into AIM that uses declarative YAML rules to classify and update asset properties.

Each rule defines **conditions** (what to match) and **actions** (what to set) — enabling AIM to automatically:
- Detect environments like *staging*, *production*, or *development*
- Identify exposed or internal assets
- Assign owners and departments
- Apply technology or business tags
- Enrich assets with metadata from integrations or risk data

The engine runs continuously, ensuring every new or updated asset stays correctly labeled and ready for analysis.

## How to Manage Rules

<Frame caption="YAML Editor for Asset Rules">
  <img src="/images/aim/classifiers2.png" alt="Rule Management Interface" />
</Frame>

Each rule in AIM is defined in YAML format and can be created, edited, deleted, or executed directly from the UI.

### 1. Creating a New Rule

1. Go to **Classifiers → Rules**.  
2. Click **New Rule** to open the YAML editor.  
3. Write your rule logic using the provided schema (see *Rule Writing Guide* below).  
4. Click **Save** — your rule will now appear in the rule list.  

Each rule can include:
- **name** – Identifier for the rule  
- **description** – Brief explanation of its purpose  
- **product** – Module it applies to (e.g., `aim`)  
- **assetType** – Asset type it targets (e.g., `subdomain`, `ip`)  
- **match** – Conditions to check  
- **set** – Fields and values to update when the match succeeds  

---

### 2. Editing a Rule

1. Click the **Edit (✏️)** icon next to the rule you want to modify.  
2. The YAML will open in the editor for updates.  
3. Make your changes and click **Update** to save.

Edits take effect immediately, and the rule will reapply during the next run cycle.

---

### 3. Deleting a Rule

To remove an outdated or redundant rule:
1. Click the **Delete (🗑️)** icon.  
2. Confirm deletion — the rule will be permanently removed from the engine.

---

### 4. Running a Rule

Individual rules can be executed on-demand to test or apply logic across your dataset.

- Click the **Run (▶️)** icon next to the rule.  
- AIM will apply the rule conditions and instantly update matching assets.  

A success notification confirms how many assets were modified.

---

### 5. Running All Rules

To execute all classification rules at once:
1. Click **Execute All Rules** in the top right corner.  
2. AIM will sequentially evaluate all rules across the active asset catalog.  
3. Updated attributes (e.g., owners, environments, or tags) will appear in real time.

This option is ideal after bulk imports or integrations.

    operator: regex
    value: "stg|\\.stg|-stg"

#### Rule Writing Guide

For a complete reference of supported operators, structure, and examples, refer to the official AIM Rule Guide below:

[Snapsec AIM Rule Guide on GitHub](https://github.com/Snap-sec/Suite-Yaml-Rule-Guides/blob/main/rule-guides/aim.md)

#### This guide includes:

- YAML syntax reference
- Match and Set operator definitions
- Advanced examples (nested conditions, transformers, logical operators)
- Best practices for writing scalable automation rules


### Best Practices

- Group rules by asset type (subdomain, ip, dns, etc.).
- Use descriptive names and clear descriptions for maintainability.
- Test new rules on a limited dataset before executing globally.
- Schedule periodic Execute All Rules runs for data consistency.
- Review rules quarterly to align with new assets or integrations.
