## Overview

The **Registries** module provides centralized visibility into all discovered container registries across your environment.  
It aggregates registry metadata, vulnerability insights, exposure status, and associations — enabling teams to secure build pipelines and monitor container supply-chain risks.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Registries** | Total number of registry assets detected (e.g., GitLab registries). |
| **Vulnerable Registries** | Registries with one or more vulnerabilities associated with their images. |
| **Exposed Registries** | Registries publicly reachable or accessible through external exposure. |
| **Shadowed Registries** | Registries found through discovery but not officially managed or tracked. |

## Severity Distribution

A donut chart visualizes overall vulnerability severity across all registry assets:

- **Critical**
- **High**
- **Medium**
- **Low**

This helps prioritize which registries require immediate attention.

## Vulnerability Distribution

A bar graph breaks down vulnerability counts across severity types, highlighting registries with the highest risk concentration.

## Registries Table

The Registries table provides detailed metadata for each registry:

### **Columns**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Asset Value** | Registry name/path such as `registry.snapsec.com/...` |
| **Source** | Origin of detection, e.g., GitLab. |
| **Vuln Count** | Number of vulnerabilities associated with registry images. |
| **Auto Risk** | Automated risk rating based on severity + exposure. |
| **Owner** | Assigned owner (if any). |
| **Tags** | Classification tags like `gitlab`, `container-registry`, `vm`, `registry`. |
| **Associations** | Linked assets (e.g., applications, images). |
| **Detected On** | Timestamp of first/last detection for lifecycle tracking. |

## Search, Filters & Sorting

Users can refine registry results through:

- **Adapters** (e.g., GitLab)
- **Owners**
- **Risk scores**
- **Exposure**
- **hasVulns** (show only vulnerable registries)

This enables targeted analysis of critical repository and registry surfaces.
