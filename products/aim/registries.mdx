## Overview

The **Registries Dashboard** provides a centralized view of all container registries discovered across your organization, including cloud-based and on-prem registries.

This view helps security and platform teams quickly understand registry exposure, vulnerability posture, and ownership status.

### What the Dashboard Shows

- **Total Registries** — All detected container registries  
- **Vulnerable Registries** — Registries with associated vulnerabilities  
- **Exposed Registries** — Internet-facing or externally reachable registries  
- **Shadowed Registries** — Unmanaged or unknown registries  

The dashboard also includes:

- **Severity Distribution** — Critical, High, Medium, Low breakdown  
- **Vulnerability Distribution** — Count by severity  
- **Environment Distribution** — Prod, Dev, Staging (when available)  

Below the charts, the registry table allows users to:

- Search registries by name  
- Filter by adapters and owners  
- Sort by vulnerability count or detection time  

Each row represents a single registry asset tracked by AIM.
