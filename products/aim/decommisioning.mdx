## Overview

**Asset Decommissioning** helps you maintain an accurate and clean inventory by retiring assets that are no longer active or relevant.  
AIM supports both **automatic** and **manual** decommissioning — ensuring minimal false positives and maintaining traceability for every change.

## Automatic Decommissioning (Adapter-Driven)


<Frame caption="Staged Decommissioned Assets">
  <img style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} src="/images/aim/decommission5.png" />
</Frame>

Adapters continuously monitor external platforms like **Cloudflare**, **AWS**, or **GitHub** to detect when assets disappear or become inactive.  
When such assets are found missing, AIM automatically moves them to a **Staged** state rather than directly decommissioning them.

This two-step model reduces false positives and ensures human review before removal.


### Workflow

1. **Adapter Detection** — System identifies that an asset (e.g., DNS record, IP, or repo) no longer exists in the source.
2. **Move to Staged Mode** — Asset is marked as *Staged for Decommission* for review.
3. **Manual Review & Approval** — A user can later confirm decommissioning from the **Staged** section.

> ⚙️ Example: If your DNS adapter previously detected `api.example.com` in Cloudflare, but the record was later removed, it will move to **Staged Decommission** automatically.

## Manual Decommissioning

</Frame>

Manual decommissioning allows users to retire an asset directly from the **Assets** view.  
This is typically done when teams know a resource is intentionally removed, outdated, or migrated.



### Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Asset Record" icon="file-lines">
    Navigate to the asset you want to retire from the **Assets** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Decommission Asset" icon="trash">
    The button appears on the asset’s detail card.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide a Reason" icon="comment-dots">
    Enter a justification for why the asset is being decommissioned (e.g., “This domain is no longer needed and has been taken down.”)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm the Action" icon="circle-check">
    Once confirmed, the asset will be marked as **Decommissioned** and moved to the dedicated listing.
  </Step>

## Viewing Decommissioned Assets

The **Decommissioned** section provides a summary of all retired assets, along with reasons, responsible users, and source adapters.

### Columns Explained

| Column | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Asset Value** | Name or identifier of the retired asset |
| **Reason** | Explanation recorded at decommission time |
| **Decommissioned By** | The user who confirmed the action |
| **Source** | Adapter or discovery source of the asset |
| **Action** | Option to Reactivate the asset if needed |

  <Step title="Locate the Asset" icon="search">
    Find the asset you want to restore in the list. You can use filters like *Adapter*, *Risk*, or *Source* for quick lookup.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Reactivate Asset" icon="rotate-left">
    Click the **Reactivate Asset** button on the right side of the asset row.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Asset Reactivated" icon="circle-check">
    The asset will move back to the **Active** inventory and resume normal monitoring through adapters.

## Best Practices

- Always review **Staged** assets before confirming decommissioning.  
- Record clear reasons for every manual decommission to maintain audit trails.  
- Periodically check if any decommissioned assets have resurfaced via integrations.  
- Use adapter-driven automation to avoid stale inventory while reducing manual oversight.
