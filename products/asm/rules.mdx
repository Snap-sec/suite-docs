Exposure rules are **policy as code** for ASM. They evaluate discovered assets and tag what should be treated as an **exposure**—with the severity, labels, and notes you decide.
</Banner>

## Overview

Exposure Rules use our YAML **Rule Engine** to translate human-readable policy into executable queries.  
Each rule inspects asset metadata (subdomains, IPs, ports, tech, certs, DNS, screenshots, etc.) and, when matched, **marks the asset/exposure**, assigns **severity**, and optionally **sets attributes** (e.g., category, ownerHint, runbookLink).

</Frame>

- **Input:** Discovered assets from ASM scans (Subdomains, IPs, Web Servers, Ports, DNS, Certificates, Technologies…).
- **Logic:** YAML rules (match + optional set).
- **Output:** Standardized **Exposures** in the Exposures module, ready for triage, dashboards, and reporting.

---

## How it Works (Evaluation Cycle)

1. **Scan completes** → assets are normalized & enriched.  
2. **Rules execute** in order (you can reorder; most specific first is recommended).  
3. If a rule’s `match` is satisfied:  
   - An exposure is created/updated and **fields in `set` are applied** (severity/category/notes/etc.).  
   - The asset keeps the exposure tag for history & trend charts.  
4. **Conflicts:** If multiple rules match, we **merge `set` fields**; the **highest severity wins**.

> The syntax and operators are the same as the **YAML Rule Engine** used across Suite. Full guide below.

## YAML Rule Guide (quick-start)

Rules follow the same structure described in the Rule Engine docs you provided:

```yaml
name: "<policy title>"
description: "<why this matters>"
severity: <critical|high|medium|low>
product: asm-exposures
assetType: <subdomain|ip|web|port|dns|certificate|technology>
match:   # field/operator/value conditions
  - field: ...
    operator: ...
    value: ...
set:     # optional: fields to set on the matched exposure
  - field: category
    value: "attack-surface"
```
