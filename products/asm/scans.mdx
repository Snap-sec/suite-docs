The **Scans** page is where your **Attack Surface Management (ASM)** journey begins.  
It allows security teams to **initiate discovery scans**, track their progress, and monitor how your external footprint evolves over time.

Each scan performs deep reconnaissance across multiple sources — DNS, IP ranges, certificate transparency logs, and third-party datasets — to uncover every publicly accessible asset related to your organization.

## Overview

The Scans page presents a **dashboard view** and a **list of executed scans**, providing full visibility into the discovery process and historical changes in your attack surface.

**Key Highlights:**
- Track discovery trends over time.  
- View each scan’s **status**, **progress**, and **execution date**.  
- Measure **growth or reduction** in total detected assets.  
- Identify **newly added** or **removed** assets since the last scan.

---

## Asset Discovery Trend

At the top of the page, a dynamic graph visualizes the **total number of assets detected** over time.

<Frame caption="Discovery trend line showing assets detected per scan">

</Frame>

This graph helps you:
- See how your attack surface expands or contracts across scans.  
- Evaluate the impact of remediation actions.  
- Identify unusual spikes that may indicate new deployments or shadow infrastructure.

## Scan List

<Frame caption="Scan list showing domain scans, asset counts, and execution status">
  <img src="/images/asm/scans3.png" alt="ASM Scan List" />
</Frame>

Each scan entry represents a **complete discovery cycle** for a specific domain or root organization.

| Field | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Target Domain** | The root domain or scope of the scan. |
| **Status** | Displays whether the scan is *Running*, *Completed*, or *Failed*. |
| **New Assets** | The number of assets discovered for the first time in this scan. |
| **Total Exposures** | Exposures detected during the discovery process. |
| **Execution Date** | The date the scan was executed. |
| **Progress Bar** | Visual indicator of the scan’s completion percentage. |



**Status indicators:**
- 🟢 **Completed** — Scan successfully finished and results are available.  
- 🔵 **Running** — Scan is in progress; assets are still being discovered.  
- 🔴 **Failed** — Scan could not be executed (connectivity or configuration issues).

## Creating a New Scan

<Frame caption="Create new scan modal for initiating discovery">
  <img src="/images/asm/scans.png" alt="Create New Scan Modal" />
</Frame>

To initiate a new scan, click **“Create Scan”** at the top right of the page.  
A modal will appear, prompting you to enter the **root domain** or target organization.



Once created:
- The scan automatically begins enumerating all related subdomains, IPs, certificates, and technologies.  
- Progress updates in real time under the **Running** state.  
- Upon completion, newly detected assets are added to the **Asset Catalog**.

## How Scans Work

Each scan performs a **multi-layered discovery process**, combining:
1. **Passive Discovery** — certificate transparency logs, WHOIS data, ASN mappings, public datasets.  
2. **Active Enumeration** — DNS brute-forcing, subdomain resolvers, and HTTP fingerprinting.  
3. **Asset Enrichment** — correlating discovered items with IPs, ports, and technologies.  
4. **Exposure Detection** — scanning for misconfigurations, open ports, and public access.

All discovered assets are automatically de-duplicated and enriched before being reflected in your **Asset Catalog**.

---

## Continuous Monitoring

By scheduling scans periodically, ASM enables **continuous asset discovery**.  
This helps you stay ahead of emerging risks by:

- Detecting **newly exposed assets** in near real time.  
- Tracking **changes to existing infrastructure**.  
- Monitoring for **re-emergence of deprecated systems**.  
- Quantifying the **impact of remediation and hardening efforts**.

---

## Best Practices

- 🕒 **Run scans regularly** — weekly or monthly to maintain up-to-date visibility.  
- 🎯 **Scope scans smartly** — include all known domains and third-party integrations.  
- 🔁 **Correlate results** — review detected assets under the **Asset Catalog** for validation.  
- 📈 **Monitor trends** — use the asset detection graph to assess ROI of remediation efforts.

## Value to Security Teams

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Automated Discovery** | Continuous scanning ensures no external asset is missed. |
| **Attack Surface Reduction** | Identify, prioritize, and remove unnecessary exposures. |
| **Historical Tracking** | Compare asset counts across scans to track posture improvements. |
| **Operational Efficiency** | Save manual effort through automation and real-time enrichment. |
