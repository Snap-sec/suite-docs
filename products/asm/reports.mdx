## Overview

The Reports page in **Attack Surface Management (ASM)** allows you to generate and view detailed and compliance-ready security reports.  
Each report contains a full summary of your organization's external attack surface, exposures, and actionable remediation steps.

Generated reports are automatically archived for auditing and tracking purposes, ensuring transparency and repeatability for quarterly or ad-hoc assessments.
