Integrations bridge the **Attack Surface Management (ASM)** and **Vulnerability Management (VM)** modules.  
They allow all detected exposures to be automatically synced into VM as tickets for centralized tracking and remediation.

## Overview

The **Integrations page** enables organizations to link their ASM findings to a specific **assessment** in VM.  
Once linked, all detected exposures are sent as **tickets**, allowing unified monitoring and lifecycle tracking — from detection to closure.

## Key Capabilities

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Assessment Selection" icon="list-tree">
  Choose an active **VM assessment** where all ASM exposures should be sent.  
  This could be a quarterly assessment, continuous scan, or any custom project.
</Card>

<Card title="One-Click Sync" icon="rotate">
  Use the **Sync Vulns** button to immediately push all exposures into VM.  
  Each exposure is converted into a ticket with its reason, severity, and asset context.
</Card>

<Card title="Auto Status Tracking" icon="arrows-rotate">
  ASM automatically **tracks exposure resolution** back from VM.  
  When an exposure ticket is marked as resolved in VM, the ASM status updates in real-time.
</Card>

<Card title="Centralized Visibility" icon="eye">
  View your entire attack surface and remediation status across both products from one place.
</Card>

## Workflow Example

1. Select your desired **assessment** (e.g., *Q1 - Attack Surface Management*).  
2. Click **Sync Vulns** to export all ASM exposures to VM.  
3. Each exposure becomes a ticket with full context (asset, reason, severity, etc.).  
4. Once developers fix the issue and close the ticket in VM, ASM reflects the change automatically.

---

### Example Use Case

- ASM detects several IPs with **open SSH ports (22)** and **expired SSL certificates**.  
- You sync them to VM under *Continuous Vulnerability Scanning*.  
- The VM team triages, assigns owners, and tracks SLAs.  
- When tickets are closed, ASM marks those exposures as **Resolved** automatically.

## Benefits

✅ Unified visibility between ASM discovery and VM remediation  
✅ Automated exposure tracking and closure validation  
✅ Reduced manual overhead in managing attack surface risks  
✅ Cross-module consistency for reporting and compliance
