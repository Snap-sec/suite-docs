## Overview

The **ASM Dashboard** provides a complete, real-time overview of your organization’s external attack surface.  
It helps you visualize discovered assets, exposed services, open ports, and potential risks — all aggregated from continuous reconnaissance and scanning.

This centralized view enables security teams to **track discovery trends**, **analyze exposure**, and **prioritize risk reduction efforts** across their infrastructure.

## Key Metrics

At the top of the dashboard, you’ll find a summary of core visibility and exposure metrics:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Subdomains** | Total discovered subdomains linked to your organization. |
| **Ports** | Unique open ports identified across hosts and IPs. |
| **Services** | Active services detected across the external network. |
| **Technologies** | Frameworks, platforms, and products identified during scanning. |
| **Web Servers** | Hosts serving HTTP/HTTPS content. |
| **IP Addresses** | Unique IPs associated with your assets. |
| **Certificates** | SSL/TLS certificates found across hosts. |
| **DNS Records** | Total DNS entries discovered. |
| **Exposures** | Known risks or misconfigurations identified. |
| **Scans** | The number of reconnaissance scans executed. |

## Visual Analytics

The dashboard features multiple visual charts that break down your external posture.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Port Exposure Analysis" icon="server">
    Displays distribution of open ports (e.g., 80, 443, 8080) to help identify unnecessary exposures.
  </Card>
  <Card title="WAF Coverage Analysis" icon="shield">
    Shows what percentage of assets are protected by a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Geographic Asset Distribution" icon="globe">
    Highlights the geographical location of your exposed assets, revealing region-based exposure trends.
  </Card>
  <Card title="DNS Record Distribution" icon="cloud">
    Visualizes DNS record types (A, CNAME, TXT, MX, etc.) for better infrastructure mapping.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Technology Used" icon="microchip">
    Summarizes detected technologies such as Nginx, React, jQuery, Node.js, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Subdomain Distribution" icon="list">
    Displays the percentage of **live** vs **dead** subdomains, reflecting cleanup and active surface size.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## Value to Security Teams

- **Instant Visibility:** Understand your exposed assets at a glance.  
- **Data-Driven Prioritization:** Identify critical areas with the most open ports or missing protections.  
- **Continuous Tracking:** Visualize trends across scans to measure attack surface growth or reduction.  
- **Cross-Domain Insights:** Correlate technologies, geolocations, and DNS data for deeper context.
