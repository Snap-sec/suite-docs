The **Exposures page** provides a unified view of all issues identified by your exposure rules — covering subdomains, IPs, ports, DNS records, certificates, APIs, and technologies.  
Every exposure is automatically created by your YAML-based detection policies.

## Overview

Exposures represent **validated risks** automatically derived from your discovered assets.  
Each entry contains:

- **Asset & Type** – The resource impacted (e.g., IP, Subdomain, Certificate)
- **Reason** – Why this asset was flagged (e.g., “Invalid SSL Cert”)
- **Severity** – Criticality defined by your exposure rules or manual review
- **State** – Workflow state (*In Review*, *Safe*, *Resolved*, *Not assigned*)
- **Detected At** – Timestamp of when the exposure was first observed
- **Action** – View, edit, or mark exposure as safe

<Card title="Automatic Exposure Generation" icon="sparkles">
  All exposures are **created automatically** by your YAML-based rules during scans.  
  Rules define which assets are risky and assign their severity and description.
</Card>

<Card title="Detailed Exposure Listing" icon="list-check">
  View all exposures in a structured table with filters by asset type, state, and severity.
</Card>

<Card title="Modify & Review" icon="pen-to-square">
  Analysts can manually edit the reason or change severity to refine classification accuracy.
</Card>

<Card title="Mark as Safe" icon="shield-check">

## Editing Exposures

You can **edit** any exposure directly to adjust severity or reason text.

</Frame>

### Example Use
- Adjust *Severity* from **Critical → Medium** when risk context is low.  
- Update *Reason* to add notes like “Reviewed internally – no sensitive data.”

```yaml
# Example manual review log (stored internally)
id: c15e1e8e
asset: "*.bugcrowd.com"
reason: "Exposing internal dashboard (non-sensitive)"
severity: "Low"
state: "In review"
reviewed_by: "analyst@company.com"
