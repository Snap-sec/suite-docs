## Centralized. Automated. Intelligent.

Snapsec Suite is an **end-to-end Application Security platform** built to centralize your entire security lifecycle — from asset discovery to remediation and continuous protection.  
It unites six core modules into one cohesive system, ensuring that your data, teams, and workflows stay in sync across every phase of security operations.

## The Six Pillars of Snapsec Suite

<CardGroup cols={3}>

<Card title="Vulnerability Management (VM)" icon="half-shield" href="/features/vm/introduction">
  Manage vulnerabilities from detection to remediation with full lifecycle visibility, SLA analytics, and automation.
</Card>

<Card title="Attack Surface Management (ASM)" icon="radar" href="/features/asm/introduction">
  Discover, classify, and monitor all external assets and exposures — your first line of defense against unknown risks.
</Card>

<Card title="Asset Intelligence Management (AIM)" icon="server" href="/features/aim/introduction">
  Build a unified, living inventory of assets with contextual intelligence, ownership mapping, and environment tagging.
</Card>

<Card title="Threat Management (TM)" icon="threat-alert" href="/features/tm/introduction">
  Aggregate, correlate, and prioritize threat data from multiple sources to support proactive risk response.
</Card>

<Card title="Vulnerability Scanning (VS)" icon="bug" href="/features/vs/introduction">
  Automate detection with integrated or custom scanners such as Nuclei, Trivy, and OpenVAS — all orchestrated centrally.
</Card>

<Card title="Web Application Scanner (WAS)" icon="key" href="/features/apiguard/introduction">
  Monitor, test, and protect your APIs in real time through continuous discovery, attack simulation, and enforcement.
</Card>

## Unified Data Fabric

Every module in Snapsec Suite shares a **common intelligence layer**, enabling **data correlation across all stages** of security operations:

| Source | Correlates With | Value |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **ASM** | AIM + VM | Converts discovered assets into managed entities with direct vulnerability mapping. |
| **AIM** | VM + TM | Enriches vulnerability data with ownership, environment, and business impact. |
| **VS** | VM | Automatically imports findings into assessments and triggers remediation workflows. |
| **VM** | TM | Provides live vulnerability intelligence to threat teams for contextual triage. |
| **WAS** | ASM + VM | Links API discovery data with vulnerabilities and runtime protection events. |

This inter-module correlation creates a **single source of truth** — so every finding, asset, or change request stays connected to its real-world context.

## Continuous Security Lifecycle

1. **Discover** — Identify all assets and exposures using ASM & AIM.  
2. **Assess** — Run vulnerability scans or manual tests through VS & VM.  
3. **Prioritize** — Contextualize issues with asset and threat intelligence from AIM & TM.  
4. **Remediate** — Track fixes, blockers, and change requests in VM.  
5. **Validate** — Re-test and verify patches automatically via VS.  
6. **Protect** — Monitor APIs and runtime assets with WAS.

Each step is **recorded, correlated, and measurable** — building a transparent feedback loop between detection and defense.

## The Value of Centralization

- **Single Source of Truth:** Every vulnerability, asset, and threat lives in one ecosystem.  
- **Reduced Friction:** Developers, analysts, and managers share a unified dashboard.  
- **Improved Visibility:** Complete traceability from discovery to remediation.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Context-aware prioritization based on business impact.  
- **Automation-Ready:** Integrate with CI/CD, issue trackers, or security tools through adapters.
