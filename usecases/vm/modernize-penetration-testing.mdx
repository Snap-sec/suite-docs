<Tip>
  Most organizations still run pentests as one-off events — scattered reports, no ownership, no tracking, no long-term visibility.  
  Snapsec VM turns pentesting into a continuous, structured security program.
</Tip>

## Why Modern Pentesting Matters

Traditional pentesting often relies on PDFs, emails, and spreadsheets.  
This leads to:

- No visibility across assessments  
- Slow remediation  
- Lost or duplicated findings  
- Zero long-term metrics  
- No ownership or SLA tracking  

Snapsec VM solves this by centralizing every pentest into a **unified vulnerability operations platform**.

## How Snapsec Modernizes Pentesting

<Steps>
  <Step title="Centralize All Pentest Assessments">
    Snapsec consolidates mobile, web, cloud, infrastructure, red-team, and code-review assessments into one workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Owners & Track Progress">
    Each vulnerability is automatically assigned to the right team or individual, with state tracking (in review, in progress, resolved, retest, etc.).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enforce SLAs for Timely Remediation">
    SLA dashboards highlight overdue, compliant, and unassigned vulnerabilities across departments.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Continuous Pentesting">
    Findings from new assessments merge into existing tickets to prevent duplication and create long-term visibility.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Automated Reports">
    One-click executive, asset-based, and full-detail reports accelerate communication with leadership and auditors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Pentesting Insights

<Danger>
  A recurring SQL injection identified across multiple assessments, now traced to a shared API library.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A high-severity RCE vulnerability unresolved beyond SLA and escalated to leadership.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Red-team findings linked to stale infrastructure with no asset ownership.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Unassigned vulnerabilities detected across multiple departments, blocking compliance.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Modernization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Normalize & Deduplicate Findings">
    Snapsec merges identical vulnerabilities across pentests to avoid noise.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Route Automatically to the Right Teams">
    Business-unit mapping ensures every team receives only relevant vulnerabilities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Department Performance">
    SLA reports highlight top performers, blockers, and high-risk areas.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Continuous Improvement">
    Cyclical assessments feed into maturity metrics and long-term vulnerability reduction.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get Fully Automated Reports">
    Technical and executive PDFs are generated automatically with updated data.
