<Tip>
  SLA failures are one of the biggest drivers of breach impact.  
  Snapsec VM automates SLA enforcement so nothing slips through the cracks.
</Tip>

## Why Automated SLA Enforcement Matters

Most organizations track SLAs manually — spreadsheets, emails, reminders, or ticket tags.  
This leads to:

- Missed deadlines  
- No visibility into aging issues  
- Lack of accountability  
- High-risk vulnerabilities staying open  
- Difficulty proving compliance  

Snapsec VM fixes this with **real-time SLA tracking and automated enforcement** across all vulnerabilities.
