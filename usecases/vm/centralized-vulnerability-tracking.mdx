title: "Centralized Vulnerability Tracking"
description: "Aggregate vulnerabilities from scanners, CI/CD, ASM, and manual pentests into a single unified dashboard."
mode: "wide"
---

<Tip>
  Most organizations have vulnerabilities scattered across tools — scanners, spreadsheets, emails, CI/CD logs, and pentest PDFs.  
  Snapsec VM brings everything together into <strong>one centralized vulnerability command center</strong>.
</Tip>

## Why Centralized Tracking Matters

When vulnerabilities live in different tools, teams struggle with:

- Duplicate findings  
- Lost issues  
- No single source of truth  
- No ownership or SLA tracking  
- Slow remediation  
- Hard-to-measure progress  

Snapsec VM solves this with a **unified, automated, and deduplicated vulnerability pipeline**.

<Check>
  Consolidate vulnerabilities from scanners, ASM exposures, CI/CD pipelines, and manual testers  
</Check>

<Check>
  Eliminate duplicates automatically with correlation and fingerprinting  
</Check>

<Check>
  Assign owners and track remediation using lifecycle states and SLAs  
</Check>

<Check>
  Provide leadership with a single real-time dashboard for all risks  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Centralizes Vulnerabilities

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ingest From Any Source">
    Snapsec collects vulnerabilities from scanners, pentest reports, API imports, ASM exposures, GitHub pipelines, and custom integrations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Normalize & Correlate Data">
    Findings are standardized, enriched, and matched against existing tickets to merge duplicates automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Ownership & SLAs">
    Business units and teams receive only relevant vulnerabilities with severity-based SLAs applied instantly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track State & Lifecycle">
    Each vulnerability progresses through stages: In Review, In Progress, Resolved, Retest, or Closed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visualize Everything in One Dashboard">
    Snapsec provides a single pane of glass showing severity trends, open vs closed vulnerabilities, and department performance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Centralized Tracking Insights

<Danger>
  Multiple scanners reporting the same RCE vulnerability — automatically merged into one consolidated ticket.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  An exposed ASM asset generating a vulnerability ticket with no owner, assigned automatically to the correct team.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A recurring SQL injection appearing in CI/CD and manual pentests, linked into a single long-term remediation ticket.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A department with high SLA breaches highlighted instantly for escalation.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Aggregation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Classify By Severity & Impact">
    Snapsec scores and categorizes vulnerabilities using enriched metadata and industry standards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Route to Correct Teams">
    Business unit mapping ensures vulnerabilities reach the right owners immediately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Remediation Progress">
    Dashboards highlight trends, blockers, SLA breaches, and performance metrics.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retest Automatically">
    When fixed, vulnerabilities move into retest workflows to verify remediation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Report Automatically">
    Generate executive and technical reports that stay updated in real time.
  </Step>
</Steps>
