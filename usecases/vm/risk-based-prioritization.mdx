## Why Risk-Based Prioritization Matters

Traditional vulnerability scoring (like CVSS) tells you *how dangerous a vulnerability could be*,  
but not *how dangerous it is to your organization right now*.

Security teams drown in thousands of low-context findings because:

- Every issue looks equally important  
- Business-critical assets don’t get special attention  
- Cloud exposures and ASM signals aren’t considered  
- High-risk internet-facing assets get treated the same as internal dev environments  

Snapsec VM solves this by combining **asset context + exposure data + business impact** to rank vulnerabilities intelligently.

<Check>
  Evaluate vulnerabilities based on asset criticality and business unit importance  
</Check>

<Check>
  Factor in exposure signals from ASM — open ports, public access, misconfigurations  
</Check>

<Check>
  Identify attack paths, chained risks, and internet-facing severity boosts  
</Check>

<Check>
  Classify issues dynamically as real risk, not just raw CVSS numbers  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Prioritizes Risk

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enrich With Asset Context">
    Every vulnerability is enriched with host type, environment (prod/dev), business unit, and application criticality.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze Exposure Level">
    Snapsec pulls exposure insights — open ports, public accessibility, shadow IT presence, cloud misconfigurations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluate Business Impact">
    Vulnerabilities on regulated systems, revenue-generating apps, or critical business units get escalated automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recalculate Risk Dynamically">
    Risk scores update as environments change — new exposures, moved hosts, resolved dependencies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prioritize the Remediation Queue">
    Snapsec automatically ranks vulnerabilities by actual impact, not CVSS noise.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Prioritization Scenarios

<Danger>
  A medium-CVSS issue becomes **critical** because it affects an internet-facing API with open ports.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A high-severity issue is downgraded because it's on an internal dev environment with no exposure.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A low-severity misconfiguration is escalated because it impacts a regulated or financial application.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Vulnerabilities on shadow IT assets are boosted automatically due to unknown ownership and public exposure.
</Danger>
