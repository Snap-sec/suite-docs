<Tip>
  Unknown ownership is one of the biggest blockers in security triage — mapping owners automatically turns chaos into accountability.

## Why Ownership & Team Mapping Matters

Security teams often struggle with one fundamental question:  
**“Who owns this asset?”**

When ownership isn’t clear:

- Vulnerabilities remain unassigned  
- Exposures stay unresolved  
- Shadow assets multiply  
- Accountability becomes impossible  

Snapsec AIM fixes this by ensuring **every asset is mapped to a real team or owner** — automatically and consistently.

## How Ownership Mapping Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ingest Ownership Signals">
    AIM collects naming conventions, DNS roots, certificates, API metadata, user associations, and integration sources.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Correlate with Internal Directory">
    Employees, service accounts, cloud identities, and workspace owners are mapped to assets automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Team & Department Context">
    Assets inherit organizational structure — engineering, security, DevOps, product, or third-party vendors.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Highlight Unknown Owners">
    AIM flags assets with no clear ownership to prevent orphaned risk and shadow growth.
  </Step>
</Steps>
