title: "Intelligent Asset Classification"
description: "Classify assets by environment, service type, ownership, and risk using policy-driven rules."

<Tip>
  Manual tagging doesn’t scale. Policy-driven classification ensures every asset is labeled correctly — automatically and consistently.
</Tip>

## Why Intelligent Asset Classification Matters

Organizations accumulate thousands of assets across cloud, applications, employees, APIs, certificates, DNS, and infrastructure.

Without automated classification:

<Check>
  Assets remain untagged or miscategorized  
</Check>

<Check>
  Ownership becomes unclear across teams  
</Check>

<Check>
  Risk states (exposed, internal, shadowed) get missed  
</Check>

<Check>
  Environments (prod/dev/stage) are inconsistent  
</Check>

Manual sorting breaks quickly. Snapsec AIM fixes this with **rule-based, intelligent classification** that keeps your entire inventory structured.

## How Snapsec Classifies Assets Automatically

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Policy Rules">
    Teams can write YAML-based rules matching fields such as DNS records, IP ranges, vulnerability counts, sources, asset types, or metadata patterns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Match Assets to Conditions">
    AIM evaluates each asset against rule criteria — environment, exposure, ownership, tags, technologies, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply Labels, Tags & Enrichment">
    Rules automatically assign environment (prod/dev/stage), risk status, custom tags, business units, and service types.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continuously Re-Evaluate Assets">
    As assets change, AIM automatically reclassifies them to maintain accurate, real-time organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Classification Scenarios

<Danger>
  Automatically tagging IPs in RFC1918 ranges as “Internal.”
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Marking all subdomains fetched from crt.sh as “Shadowed” unless owned explicitly.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Categorizing APIs with more than 300 endpoints as “High-Impact Services.”
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Tagging certificate assets nearing expiry with “Critical-Attention.”
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Assigning owners to assets based on domain patterns or workspace attributes.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Classification

<Steps>
  <Step title="Apply Tags & Labels">
    AIM updates asset metadata instantly with new tags, risk levels, or environment classifications.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Policy Actions">
    Classified assets can be routed to VM, ASM, or ticketing flows automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Improve Visibility Across Teams">
    Consistent classification enables faster filtering, grouping, and governance across AIM, ASM, and VM.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine Over Time">
    Rules evolve with your infrastructure — AIM updates continuously as new requirements emerge.
  </Step>
</Steps>
