<Tip>
  Risk isn’t just about vulnerabilities — it’s about **which asset they belong to** and **how exposed** that asset is.
</Tip>

## Why Asset-Risk Mapping Matters

Security teams often have vulnerabilities scattered across scanners, CI/CD, ASM, cloud, and internal tooling.  
But without knowing **which asset each risk belongs to**, triage becomes slow and disconnected.

Asset-Risk Mapping solves that by:

<Check>
  Combining exposure, vulnerability, and ownership data into one asset profile  
</Check>

<Check>
  Providing context on how critical or externally-facing an asset actually is  
</Check>

<Check>
  Prioritizing risks based on business value and environment  
</Check>

<Check>
  Showing how many risks affect each asset in real time  
</Check>

This creates a **true, end-to-end picture** of what’s at risk — not just what’s vulnerable.

## How Snapsec Maps Risk to Assets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consolidate Risk Sources">
    AIM ingests vulnerabilities, exposures, API misconfigurations, expired certificates, shadow assets, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach Risk to the Correct Asset">
    Each risk is automatically linked to DNS records, certificates, APIs, IPs, applications, and employee-linked objects.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Calculate Auto-Risk Score">
    AIM uses exposure level, vulnerability severity, asset importance, and business context to compute an intelligent risk score.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visualize Risk Distribution">
    Every asset shows risk breakdowns, severity charts, environment impact, and exposure correlation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Asset-Risk Scenarios

<Danger>
  A public-facing API with 300 endpoints and 2 medium vulnerabilities receives elevated auto-risk.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  An exposed IP belonging to AWS with no owner and open ports increases risk weight instantly.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A certificate that expired 90 days ago contributes risk to all associated domains.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A shadowed subdomain with no WAF and outdated tech stack is flagged as high-risk.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  An employee account tied to external apps shows suspicious inactivity and risk accumulation.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Mapping

<Steps>
  <Step title="Risk Score Updated">
    Auto-risk recalculates dynamically based on exposures, vulnerabilities, and business context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Triage Becomes Faster">
    Assets with the highest combined risk appear at the top of dashboards.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Routing to VM">
    High-risk assets and vulnerabilities flow directly into Snapsec VM for remediation workflows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continuous Refinement">
    As new assets appear or risks change, mapping updates immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>
