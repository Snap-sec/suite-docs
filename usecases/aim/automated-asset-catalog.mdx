<Tip>
  Most organizations don't know <strong>what they own</strong>. Automated cataloging fixes the root cause of every downstream security blind spot.

## Why an Automated Asset Catalog Matters

Modern infrastructure evolves daily — APIs, domains, certificates, SaaS accounts, employees, repos, cloud services, and internal applications are created and removed constantly.

Manual spreadsheets fail because they:

<Check>
  Cannot keep up with asset creation across teams  
</Check>

<Check>
  Miss shadow or ungoverned assets  
</Check>

<Check>
  Lack ownership, metadata, or up-to-date context  
</Check>

<Check>
  Become stale within days  
</Check>

Snapsec AIM replaces unreliable, manual tracking with a **real-time, always up-to-date source of truth**.

## How Snapsec Builds the Automated Asset Catalog

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect Assets from All Sources">
    AIM aggregates assets from ASM, scanners, certificates, Postman, Swagger, Censys, cloud providers, employee lists, repositories, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Normalize & Enrich Automatically">
    Every asset gets enriched with ownership, workspace, DNS data, geolocation, tech stack, history, and exposure status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Categorize by Asset Type">
    Assets are intelligently classified into subdomains, APIs, IPs, DNS records, certificates, applications, employees, technologies, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Maintain a Live Inventory">
    AIM detects changes, adds new assets, flags missing ones, and updates metadata continuously — no manual input required.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Asset Insights from AIM

<Danger>
  An API with 880 discovered endpoints and no documented owner.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Subdomains fetched from certificate transparency logs mapped to no team.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  IPs exposed publicly with unknown origin or expired certificates.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Employee accounts inactive for months but still technically “active.”
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Applications running outdated tech stacks without visibility.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Cataloging

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enrich the Asset">
    AIM augments the asset with DNS, endpoints, association data, owner detection, and technology fingerprints.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Classify Automatically">
    YAML-based classifiers tag assets by environment, exposure, risk, or policy logic.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect Issues">
    AIM highlights vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, shadowed or exposed states, and unassigned ownership.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate with VM">
    Enriched assets flow into Snapsec VM for continuous scanning, ticketing, and SLA enforcement.
  </Step>
</Steps>
