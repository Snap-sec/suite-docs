title: "Risk Pattern Analysis"
description: "Analyze system behavior and discover common attack patterns or weak controls across applications and APIs."

<Tip>
  Modern systems fail in predictable ways — identifying these patterns early prevents entire classes of vulnerabilities from ever reaching production.
</Tip>

## Why Risk Pattern Analysis Matters

Threats rarely occur in isolation.  
They follow *patterns* — insecure API behaviors, missing validations, predictable authorization gaps, and repeated misconfigurations.

Snapsec Threat Modeling identifies these patterns automatically by:

<Check>
  Analyzing threat data across APIs, services, and projects  
</Check>

<Check>
  Detecting recurring weaknesses such as broken access control or improper error handling  
</Check>

<Check>
  Identifying systemic control failures shared across multiple endpoints  
</Check>

<Check>
  Highlighting risky design patterns before they propagate into new services  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Performs Risk Pattern Analysis

<Steps>
  <Step title="Aggregate Threat Signals">
    Snapsec gathers threats from all projects, correlating them by endpoint, CWE, severity, and impact patterns.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect Repeated Weak Controls">
    The system identifies recurring gaps — such as missing authentication, improper object filtering, or unsafe HTTP methods.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Patterns to Architecture">
    Weakness clusters are linked to architectural components, revealing flawed designs or unsafe development practices.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Insights & Remediation">
    Snapsec produces clear recommendations to eliminate systemic issues across the entire application ecosystem.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Risk Patterns Detected by Snapsec

<Danger>
  Multiple endpoints return sensitive user identifiers without filtering.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Repeated IDOR findings across user-related APIs due to missing authorization checks.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Consistent lack of validation in POST/PUT requests leading to mass-assignment vulnerabilities.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Common error-handling flaws exposing stack traces across microservices.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Several services using weak or inconsistent authentication methods.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Pattern Identification

<Steps>
  <Step title="Correlate Across Systems">
    Snapsec maps the detected pattern across all affected APIs and microservices.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Surface Root Cause">
    Determines whether the issue originates from coding practices, frameworks, or architecture.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Recommend Strategic Fixes">
    Generates actionable, system-wide mitigation guidance to prevent future recurrence.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Feed Into Threat Modeling & VM">
    Patterns auto-integrate into Snapsec’s threat modeling and VM workflows for remediation and tracking.
  </Step>
</Steps>
