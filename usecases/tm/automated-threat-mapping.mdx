<Tip>
  Stop manually translating architecture diagrams into attack scenarios — Snapsec generates a complete threat map instantly.

## Why Automated Threat Mapping Matters

Traditional threat modeling takes days or weeks because teams must manually:

- Interpret architecture diagrams  
- Review API collections  
- Identify trust boundaries  
- Map attack vectors  
- Document threats  

This slows down engineering cycles and makes threat modeling a bottleneck.

Snapsec solves this by **automatically converting system architecture or API definitions into a full threat map** — in seconds.

<Check>
  Auto-detects components, data flows, trust boundaries, and interaction surfaces  
</Check>

<Check>
  Generates relevant threats for each component or endpoint  
</Check>

<Check>
  Provides a visual threat topology to improve developer understanding  
</Check>

<Check>
  Ensures consistency across all threat modeling projects

## How Snapsec Generates a Threat Map

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload a Diagram or API Collection">
    Start by adding a system diagram, sequence diagram, OpenAPI/Swagger spec, or Postman collection.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Parse Components & Data Flows">
    Snapsec analyzes services, endpoints, trust boundaries, data stores, roles, and connections.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Threat Candidates">
    Using AI-powered models, Snapsec identifies threats aligned with STRIDE, OWASP API Top 10, and CWE.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Render the Visual Threat Map">
    A complete threat graph is produced showing nodes (assets) and edges (attack paths), linked to real threats.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Outputs

<Danger>
  Threat paths showing how a compromised microservice can escalate into sensitive data access.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Threats mapped to endpoints lacking authentication or input validation.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Identified weak trust boundaries between public and internal components.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Mapping

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Threats">
    All generated threats appear in the Threat Review Console with severity, references, and mitigation steps.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Owners">
    Each threat is assigned to relevant engineering or security teams for triage.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Integrate With Projects">
    Threats are synced automatically to the associated threat modeling project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Lifecycles">
    Threats move through Pending → Acknowledged → In Progress → Fixed → Fix Verified.
  </Step>
</Steps>
