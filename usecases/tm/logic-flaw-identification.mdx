<Tip>
  Logic flaws break systems in ways scanners cannot detect — Snapsec identifies them automatically through behavioral analysis.

## Why Logic Flaw Identification Matters

Automated scanners catch technical issues — but **logic flaws** require understanding:

- How flows work  
- What assumptions developers made  
- Where trust boundaries break  
- How user roles interact  
- How states change across requests  

Snapsec detects these weaknesses using pattern analysis and request-flow intelligence.

## How Snapsec Detects Logic Flaws

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze API Flows">
    Snapsec studies sequences of requests and responses, identifying weak assumptions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect Broken Authorization">
    Finds missing object-level checks, broken role policies, and lateral movement opportunities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluate State & Workflow Logic">
    Identifies bypass opportunities in multi-step flows like payments, onboarding, or role escalations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Map Logic Risks to Endpoints">
    Each flaw is tied to the exact API route or component that creates the vulnerability.
  </Step>
</Steps>
