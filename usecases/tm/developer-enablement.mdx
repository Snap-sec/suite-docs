<Tip>
  Security works only when developers have **clear, practical, and contextual guidance** at their fingertips.
</Tip>

## Why Developer Enablement Matters

Even the best threat models fail if developers don't have actionable steps to remediate issues.

Traditional advice is:

- Too generic  
- Too high-level  
- Not tied to the API or system the team is building  

Snapsec fixes this with **precise, developer-friendly security guidance**.
