<Tip>
  Understand which assets pose **real risk** — not just which ones exist.

## Why Asset Risk Analysis Matters

Not all assets carry the same risk. Some are inactive but still exposed, others are misconfigured, and many accumulate vulnerabilities over time.  
Traditional inventories fail to evaluate **which assets need immediate attention**.

Snapsec ASM solves this by:

<Check>
  Classifying assets as live, inactive, misconfigured, or high-risk based on continuous analysis  
</Check>

<Check>
  Detecting risky configurations, outdated technologies, and unprotected services  
</Check>

<Check>
  Prioritizing assets by severity, exposure type, and exploitation likelihood  
</Check>

<Check>
  Enriching assets with ports, DNS, certificates, technologies, and cloud metadata  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Performs Risk Analysis

<Steps>
  <Step title="Collect Environmental Context">
    Every asset — subdomain, IP, port, server, or technology — is enriched with metadata like DNS, tags, cloud ownership, technologies, and historical behavior.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Evaluate Exposure & Misconfigurations">
    ASM detects dangerous configurations including open ports, outdated software, missing WAF, expired certificates, and risky DNS setups.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Classify Asset Risk Level">
    Assets are categorized into live, inactive, misconfigured, or high-risk groups using Snapsec’s risk engine.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prioritize & Alert">
    High-risk assets are escalated with severity scoring and pushed into VM workflows for rapid remediation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example High-Risk Conditions

<Danger>
  Active assets running outdated, vulnerable software versions.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Inactive subdomains still resolving with open ports.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Exposed IPs reachable without any access control.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Web servers without WAF protection.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Assets using expired or weak SSL/TLS certificates.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Technology stacks exposing sensitive debug or admin functionality.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Risk Evaluation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enrich the Risk Profile">
    Each risky asset is paired with metadata like ports, DNS, technologies, certificate status, and cloud context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Classify & Score">
    ASM uses policy rules and AI analysis to generate a risk score based on severity, exposure type, and exploitation likelihood.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate AI Report">
    ASM automatically produces a risk-focused report with impact, reasoning, and step-by-step remediation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send to VM Tickets">
    High-risk assets are synced into Snapsec VM for tracking, assignment, and resolution.
  </Step>
</Steps>
