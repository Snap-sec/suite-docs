title: "External Asset Discovery"
description: "Automatically discover every internet-facing asset tied to your organization — domains, subdomains, IPs, servers, APIs, cloud resources, and more."

<Tip>
  Stay ahead of attackers by mapping your **real** external footprint — not the one in spreadsheets.
</Tip>

## Why External Asset Discovery Matters

Most security teams operate with incomplete visibility. New subdomains get deployed, forgotten assets stay online, and cloud teams spin up resources without notifying security.\
These unnoticed assets become easy entry points.

Snapsec ASM solves this by:

<Check>
   Continuously scanning the internet for your organization's footprint  
</Check>

<Check>
  Identifying domains, subdomains, IPs, servers, APIs, and cloud services  
</Check>

<Check>
  Building a real-time, unified view of all external-facing assets  
</Check>

<Check>
  Detecting shadow IT, stale systems, and high-risk exposures  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Discovers Assets

<Steps>
  <Step title="Provide Your Starting Point">
    Add your root domain, company name, or cloud identifiers — Snapsec automatically builds discovery pivots from it.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Map the Entire Surface">
    Our discovery engine identifies all exposed domains, subdomains, IPs, APIs, ports, and services across the internet.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enrich and Classify">
    Every asset is enriched with ownership, environment, DNS records, tech stack, and risk scoring.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor for New Exposures">
    Snapsec continuously watches for new assets, changes, or high-risk exposures and alerts you instantly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Findings

These are typical high-impact discoveries Snapsec ASM uncovers in organizations:

<Danger>
  Forgotten staging or development environments exposed to the internet.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Subdomains pointing to unused or publicly accessible cloud storage buckets.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Unauthenticated API endpoints leaking sensitive data or internal functionality.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Exposed admin panels or management interfaces without proper access controls.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Legacy SaaS instances still mapped to company DNS with outdated configurations.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Publicly reachable services or ports left open from old infrastructure deployments.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Discovery

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enrich the Asset">
    ASM enhances each discovered asset using multiple adapters — IP intelligence, DNS records, technology fingerprints, cloud metadata, Nmap scans, and more.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classify with Policy Engine">
    Using Snapsec's policy engine, assets are classified across multiple dimensions: environment (prod/dev/stg), type (subdomain, IP, API, bucket), ownership, and risk context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Evaluate Exposure">
    ASM categorizes assets into <strong>good exposures</strong> (intended and safe) and <strong>bad exposures</strong> (misconfigured, risky, or unintended).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate AI Report">
    For every bad exposure, ASM automatically creates an AI-generated report summarizing the issue, impact, and remediation guidance.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to VM Tickets">
    Exposure reports are pushed directly into Snapsec VM's ticket management system for seamless triage, tracking, and remediation.
  </Step>
</Steps>
