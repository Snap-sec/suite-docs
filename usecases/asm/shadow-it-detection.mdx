<Tip>
  Most organizations discover assets <strong> after attackers do <strong/>. Shadow IT is one of the largest and most dangerous contributors to breach events.
</Tip>

## Why Shadow IT Detection Matters

Modern engineering teams move fast — spinning up test environments, temporary domains, and cloud resources without notifying security.  
Over time, these become **invisible attack entry points**.

Snapsec ASM eliminates this by:

<Check>
  Continuously scanning for assets created outside IT or security governance  
</Check>

<Check>
  Detecting unknown subdomains, abandoned endpoints, and untracked cloud services  
</Check>

<Check>
  Identifying risky assets with open ports, no WAF, or public exposure  
</Check>

<Check>
  Correlating shadow assets with real owners using enrichment and attribution  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Detects Shadow IT

<Steps>
  <Step title="Map All External-Facing Assets">
    ASM discovers every domain, subdomain, IP, web server, technology, and certificate tied to your organization — even those not recorded internally.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Unapproved or Inactive Services">
    Using activity signals, DNS analysis, hosting intelligence, and certificate data, ASM identifies assets that were created outside official workflows.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Highlight Risky Exposures">
    Shadow assets often have no WAF, outdated software, misconfigurations, or publicly exposed services — ASM flags all of these instantly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attribute Ownership Automatically">
    ASM correlates assets with internal teams using email patterns, DNS roots, cloud metadata, and naming conventions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Shadow IT Findings

<Danger>
  A forgotten subdomain pointing to an outdated web application with open ports.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A cloud worker endpoint exposed publicly with no authentication.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  An inactive environment still resolving in DNS, serving 404 pages but reachable to attackers.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  An old certificate still mapped to an unused domain.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A test API endpoint exposing server response metadata publicly.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Detection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate the Asset">
    ASM verifies DNS, hosting signatures, and service activity to confirm it’s a real asset.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attribute Ownership">
    Metadata and fingerprinting are used to map the asset to a probable internal team.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Classify Risk Level">
    Exposure type, ports, and technologies determine whether it's low-risk or high-risk.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate AI Exposure Report">
    A detailed report is created explaining impact, severity, and remediation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send to VM for Remediation">
    The exposure is pushed into Snapsec VM for triage, ticketing, and assignment.
  </Step>
</Steps>
