<Tip>
  Detect changes **as they happen**, not after attackers exploit them.
</Tip>

## Why Exposure Change Monitoring Matters

Attack surfaces evolve constantly. New services come online, old ones are misconfigured, and cloud teams push updates without notifying security.

These small, unnoticed changes often introduce the highest-risk exposures.

Snapsec ASM’s Change Monitoring ensures you never miss:

<Check>
  Newly opened or closed ports  
</Check>

<Check>
  Configuration drift across production assets  
</Check>

<Check>
  Sudden exposure of previously internal services  
</Check>

<Check>
  Changes in certificates, DNS records, technologies, or WAF status  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Detects Exposure Changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Track Every Exposure Delta">
    Each scan compares current asset state with historical data to identify new, removed, or modified exposures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Detect Configuration Drift">
    Snapsec captures changes in ports, WAF status, SSL certs, DNS changes, and cloud metadata to highlight risky deviations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Flag Newly Risky Assets">
    If an asset becomes exposed — new open ports, new IP mapping, or missing protections — it is immediately highlighted.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger Early Alerts">
    Snapsec notifies teams instantly when meaningful attack surface changes occur so remediation can begin right away.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Exposure Changes Detected

These are typical high-impact changes Snapsec identifies:

<Danger>
  A safe port becomes exposed after a misconfigured deployment.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A previously internal development server becomes public due to DNS drift.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A WAF is disabled or stops protecting a critical subdomain.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  SSL certificates suddenly become invalid or expire.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Cloud metadata changes expose unintended public endpoints.
</Danger>

## What Happens After a Change is Detected

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze the Change">
    Snapsec records the previous asset state and shows exactly what changed — port, DNS, certificate, or technology.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Classify with Policy Engine">
    Changes are evaluated against your exposure policies to determine whether they are safe or risky.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate AI Report">
    A detailed AI report is created explaining the change, its impact, and actionable remediation steps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send to VM Tickets">
    Exposure change reports are pushed directly to the VM pipeline for tracking, assignment, and resolution.
  </Step>
</Steps>
