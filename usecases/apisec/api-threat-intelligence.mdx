<Tip>
  APIs expose critical business logic — pairing them with real threat intelligence reveals where attackers will strike first.
</Tip>

## Why API Threat Intelligence Matters

Most API security tools detect vulnerabilities —  
but they **don’t tell you which endpoints attackers actively target**.

Modern attackers:

<Check>Scan for known exploitable routes</Check>
<Check>Target outdated frameworks and tech stacks</Check>
<Check>Attack APIs exposing sensitive data patterns</Check>
<Check>Prefer weakly authenticated or undocumented endpoints</Check>

Snapsec automatically correlates your APIs with live threat intelligence to uncover **which endpoints present the highest real-world risk**.

## How Snapsec Applies Threat Intelligence

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fingerprint API Endpoints">
    Snapsec analyzes technologies, paths, parameters, auth patterns, and data exposure signals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Match With Global Threat Feeds">
    Endpoint patterns are compared against known exploits, CVEs, CWE mappings, attacker TTPs, and API-specific IoCs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Intelligence-Based Risk">
    Endpoints receive dynamic risk levels based on exploitability, exposure, tech stack age, and attacker behavior.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Highlight High-Risk Surfaces">
    Snapsec flags endpoints likely to be targeted — sensitive object APIs, unprotected routes, legacy paths, and more.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Intelligence-Driven Findings

<Danger>
  Endpoint matches pattern of a known exploit chain used against similar fintech APIs.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Legacy route leaking stack traces during threat-intel-based probing.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Sensitive object endpoint exposed without authentication — high attacker interest.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  API using outdated framework version targeted in active CVE campaigns.
</Danger>
