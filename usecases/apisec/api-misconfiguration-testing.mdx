<Tip>
  Most API breaches happen due to simple misconfigurations — not complex exploits. Snapsec helps you catch them early.
</Tip>

## Why API Misconfiguration Testing Matters

APIs often expose more than intended.  
A single incorrect header or open debug route can leak data or enable attacker pivoting.

Common issues include:

<Check>Overly permissive CORS policies</Check>
<Check>Debug or admin endpoints exposed publicly</Check>
<Check>Missing authentication on sensitive routes</Check>
<Check>Verbose error responses leaking stack traces</Check>
<Check>Misconfigured rate limits or payload validation</Check>

Snapsec automatically identifies these weaknesses before attackers do.

## How Snapsec Detects API Misconfigurations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Response Headers">
    Snapsec checks CORS, cache-control, content-type, and security headers for insecure or missing values.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Probe Debug & Hidden Endpoints">
    The scanner identifies debug routes, admin paths, or undocumented endpoints leaking internal behavior.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess Access Control Configurations">
    Snapsec verifies whether endpoints require authentication and flags sensitive routes left unprotected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Error Handling & Verbosity">
    It monitors error messages for stack traces, technology leaks, or internal details useful to attackers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for Over-Exposure">
    Snapsec looks for excessive fields, unnecessary metadata, and misconfigured response structures.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Findings

<Danger>
  API allows <code>*</code> origin with credentialed requests — critical CORS bypass risk.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Debug endpoint <code>/internal/status</code> publicly exposed and leaking stack details.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Sensitive endpoint <code>/admin/export</code> allows requests without authentication.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  API returns full internal user objects including unnecessary fields.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Detection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auto-Generate Exposure Report">
    Snapsec produces a detailed summary with impact and mitigation guidance.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send to VM">
    Issues route directly to Snapsec VM for triage and developer assignment.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-Test After Fix">
    Automated validation confirms whether the misconfiguration is resolved.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continuously Monitor">
    Snapsec checks future scans to ensure the issue doesn't reappear.
  </Step>
