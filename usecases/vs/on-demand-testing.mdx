title: "On-Demand Vulnerability Testing"
description: "Trigger manual or CI/CD-based scans for instant, real-time security validation."

<Tip>
  On-demand scans help teams validate security the moment code changes, without waiting for scheduled cycles.
</Tip>

## Why On-Demand Scanning Matters

Engineering teams deploy updates frequently — every change carries the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities.

On-demand scanning ensures:

<Check>Immediate validation before releases</Check>
<Check>Security checks integrated directly into CI/CD</Check>
<Check>Developers get instant feedback</Check>
<Check>Critical assets can be tested anytime</Check>

## What Problem This Solves

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card icon="bolt" title="Slow Manual Testing Cycles">
    Traditional pentesting can't keep up with agile releases.
  </Card>

  <Card icon="code-commit" title="Unsafe Deployments">
    Code changes go to production without security validation.

  <Card icon="house-fire" title="High Risk of Regression">
    Fixes break, vulnerabilities reappear — on-demand scanning catches them instantly.

## How Snapsec Performs On-Demand Testing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Asset or Group">
    Choose a specific API, application, server, domain, or group to test instantly.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Scan Manually or via CI/CD API">
    Developers or security teams launch an immediate scan with one click or pipeline call.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Full/Quick/Targeted Tests">
    Snapsec supports rapid tests or deep-dive vulnerability analysis based on need.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect & Classify Issues">
    CVEs, OWASP issues, misconfigurations, missing headers, exposed services, and more are flagged.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Findings to VM or Ticketing">
    Results flow into Snapsec VM (and Jira, Slack, Teams) for remediation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example On-Demand Findings

<Danger>
  Debug Mode Enabled in Production  
  — Detected through on-demand scan before deployment.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Missing Authentication on a New Endpoint  
  — CI/CD scan caught this before merge.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Misconfigured CORS Policy  
  — Identified during developer-triggered test.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  High-Risk Library Version Introduced  
  — SCA check detects vulnerable dependency immediately.
</Danger>
