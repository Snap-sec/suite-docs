title: "Continuous Vulnerability Scanning"
description: "Automatically scan APIs, applications, servers, and cloud assets for vulnerabilities on a recurring schedule."
mode: "wide"
---

<Tip>
  Modern attack surfaces change daily. Continuous scanning ensures vulnerabilities are caught before attackers find them.
</Tip>

## Why Continuous Scanning Matters

New deployments, configuration changes, and forgotten services can silently introduce risks.  
Without ongoing scanning, vulnerabilities may remain undetected for weeks or months.

Continuous scanning helps organizations:

<Check>Catch vulnerabilities as soon as they appear</Check>
<Check>Maintain compliance with security policies & regulatory frameworks</Check>
<Check>Detect regressions introduced by new releases</Check>
<Check>Ensure all assets remain monitored over time</Check>

## What Problem This Solves

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Blind Spots Over Time" icon="eye-slash">
    Assets drift, configs change, and new services go live unnoticed — continuous scans prevent visibility gaps.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Slow Vulnerability Discovery" icon="clock">
    Without automated scanning, security teams rely on manual tests that happen too late.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Operational Security Debt" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Unpatched vulnerabilities accumulate silently, increasing long-term risk.

## How Snapsec Performs Continuous Scanning

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover All Assets Automatically">
    APIs, web apps, servers, and cloud surfaces are auto-discovered using ASM and synced to the scanner.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Scheduled Recurring Scans">
    Snapsec runs daily, weekly, or custom recurring scans without human intervention.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Detect CVEs, Misconfigs & OWASP Issues">
    The engine analyzes headers, SSL, authentication, exposures, server signatures, and known vulnerabilities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Correlate Findings With Asset Inventory">
    Each issue is linked to its exact asset, owner, and risk category.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Auto-Sync Results to VM">
    Vulnerabilities are forwarded to Snapsec VM for triage, SLA tracking, and remediation workflows.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Findings From Continuous Scanning

<Danger>
  HTTP Security Headers Missing  
  — Web app missing X-Frame-Options, CSP, HSTS.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Outdated Server With Known CVEs  
  — Apache/2.4.49 vulnerable to path traversal.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Publicly Accessible Admin Interface  
  — Admin panel exposed to the internet.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Weak SSL Configuration  
  — TLS 1.0 enabled or weak cipher suites detected.
</Danger>
