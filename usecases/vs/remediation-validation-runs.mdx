<Tip>
  Fixing a vulnerability is only half the work — verifying the fix is what closes the loop.
</Tip>

## Why Remediation Validation Matters

Teams often mark vulnerabilities as *fixed* without confirming whether:

- The patch actually applied  
- The vulnerable behavior is fully removed  
- The issue has reappeared due to rollback or misconfigurations  
- The fix introduced new regressions  

Without verification, security risks silently persist.

Snapsec Vulnerability Scanner ensures every fix is validated automatically.

<Check>
  Validate fixes instantly after engineering deploys changes  
</Check>

<Check>
  Confirm patch effectiveness using targeted re-tests  
</Check>

<Check>
  Detect regressions or partial fixes early  
</Check>

<Check>
  Provide clear evidence for SLA closure and compliance  
</Check>

## How Snapsec Performs Validation Runs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Fixed Issues">
    Once a vulnerability is marked as fixed in VM, Snapsec queues the asset for re-testing.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Targeted Scans">
    Only the affected endpoints, parameters, or assets are re-scanned to speed up validation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare Results">
    Snapsec automatically checks whether the vulnerability signature or behavior still exists.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm or Reopen">
    If resolved → marked as, Fix Verified.  
    If not → the finding automatically reopens with new evidence.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Validation Findings

<Danger>
  A SQLi issue remains exploitable after patch → Snapsec reopens automatically.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A missing authentication header reappears due to rollback → flagged immediately.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  A fixed XSS signature is fully removed → marked as Fix Verified with proof.
</Danger>

## What Happens After Validation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Update VM Status">
    Snapsec syncs results back into the VM for lifecycle accuracy.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Notify Teams">
    Engineers and security receive instant success or failure alerts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Validation Evidence">
    Full proof-of-fix is attached automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Feed Into Reporting">
    SLA charts, compliance evidence, and closure metrics update in real time.
  </Step>
</Steps>
