<Tip>
  OWASP Top-10 issues remain the most common cause of breaches. Snapsec ensures they are detected early — across APIs, applications, and microservices.
</Tip>

## Why OWASP Issue Detection Matters

Most breaches come from the same recurring vulnerability classes — broken access controls, injections, insecure components, misconfigurations, weak authentication, and logic flaws.

Traditional scanners often miss these because:

<Check>
  They rely only on static signatures  
</Check>
<Check>
  They lack behavioral and multi-step test coverage  
</Check>
<Check>
  They cannot validate vulnerable workflows end-to-end  
</Check>
<Check>
  They miss business-logic and permission-based issues  
</Check>

Snapsec’s scanner solves this using **hybrid detection** — combining signatures, request tampering, context correlation, and multi-flow behavioral tests.

## How Snapsec Detects OWASP Issues

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Endpoints & Parameters">
    Snapsec inspects every API route, method, input field, header, cookie, and authentication boundary.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Signature-Based Tests">
    Over 600+ curated checks for injection, SSRF, LFI/RFI, deserialization, leakage, misconfigurations, and more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Perform Behavioral & Stateful Testing">
    The scanner sends chained requests, permission swaps, replayed sessions, and cross-role tests to detect access control and logic vulnerabilities.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Responses & Side-Effects">
    Snapsec verifies whether the application responded abnormally — unauthorized access, unexpected data exposure, redirects, or dangerous server behavior.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Correlate Evidence Automatically">
    Each detection is supported with request/response pairs, proof snippets, reproduction steps, and CWE + OWASP mapping.
  </Step>
</Steps>
