<Tip>
  Authentication flaws are the fastest path to full system compromise — continuous detection is critical.
</Tip>

---

## Why It Matters

Broken authentication and authorization allow attackers to:

<Check>Access user accounts without credentials</Check>
<Check>Bypass role restrictions</Check>
<Check>Perform actions as other users</Check>
<Check>Exploit missing or weak token validation</Check>

Snapsec API Security continuously evaluates your authentication surfaces to ensure no weak points are left behind.

## How Snapsec Detects Auth Weaknesses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analyze Sensitive Endpoints">
    Endpoints involving login, signup, sessions, tokens, or user identifiers are automatically flagged for deeper analysis.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Role & Permission Boundaries">
    Snapsec attempts cross-role access, privilege escalation, and bypass patterns using multiple identity contexts.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate Token & Session Controls">
    Expired tokens, missing signatures, weak sessions, and replay vulnerabilities are automatically detected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for IDOR & Broken Access">
    Object-level and function-level access checks validate whether users can perform unauthorized actions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Auth Weakness Findings

<Danger>
  User with role *basic* can access `/admin/users`.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Token missing signature validation allows forged tokens.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Session does not expire after logout.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  User ID can be enumerated via predictable patterns.
</Danger>
