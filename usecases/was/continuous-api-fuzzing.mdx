<Tip>
  Traditional API testing misses edge cases — continuous fuzzing ensures your APIs are secure even under unpredictable real-world inputs.
</Tip>

## Why Continuous API Fuzzing Matters

Most API vulnerabilities appear **only when APIs receive malformed, unexpected, or extreme input values**.  
These include:

- Injection payload variants  
- Broken validation logic  
- Serialization & parser edge-case failures  
- Crashes due to type confusion or oversized requests  

Snapsec continuously fuzzes your APIs to detect issues **before attackers do**.

<Check>
  Identify high-risk injection and input-handling flaws missed by normal testing  
</Check>

<Check>
  Detect crashes, unexpected responses, and hidden API behaviors  
</Check>

<Check>
  Automatically generate malformed, random, and adversarial inputs  
</Check>

<Check>
  Continuously run fuzzing campaigns across all API endpoints

## How Snapsec Performs Continuous Fuzzing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover API Endpoints">
    Snapsec maps all API routes, parameters, headers, and request bodies automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Adversarial Inputs">
    AI-driven payload engines produce malformed, randomized, and mutation-based fuzz inputs tailored to each endpoint.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Fuzzing Campaigns">
    APIs are stress-tested with multiple request variations across methods, schemas, and parameter types.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Behavior & Failures">
    Snapsec analyzes response codes, errors, latency spikes, crashes, and parser inconsistencies.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Report Weaknesses Automatically">
    Any abnormal or risky behavior is converted into a vulnerability report with reproduction steps and fixes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Findings

<Danger>
  API returns a 500 error when receiving oversized arrays in JSON payloads.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Login endpoint accepts raw object instead of expected string → validation bypass.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  XML payloads cause parser crash exposing stack traces.
</Danger>

<Danger>
  Unexpected characters in query params reveal hidden debug behavior.
</Danger>

  <Step title="Capture Failure Evidence">
    Snapsec stores full request/response logs, parser errors, and stack traces.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Classify Weakness Type">
    Injection, crash, validation bypass, type confusion, or logic flaw.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate AI Fix Guidance">
    A detailed remediation plan is generated automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send to VM for Tracking">
    Issues are synced instantly to Snapsec VM for assignment and SLA handling.
